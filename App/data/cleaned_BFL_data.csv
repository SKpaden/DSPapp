We spent a moment shovelling snow onto the “running exit”. The plan was that I would do a ski base first and Antony would follow shortly after doing a sled-exit with a wingsuit (wooden sled with two metal rails).
The snow was sticky, and Antony mentioned that there was less snow than the last time he was there. I jumped first and exited with a lot of speed. Everything went well. Antony went second and I saw him in an unstable body position shortly after the exit. I stayed calm because I knew that Antony had trained to regain stability in wingsuits.
But then he showed no sign of making any effort to correct the rather slow spin. His head was resting against his chest as if he was already unconscious. He fell in this position until he hit the bottom of the cliff and came to rest on the talus.
Shortly before the jump, I asked Antony what he thought about me doing a front flip on skis. He told me that he was afraid of the first ledge which is about 30 meters below the exit. So, I decided to do a normal exit. When Antony did his first wingsuit sled-exit at Dumpster ( plastic sled, in a sitting position )he came close to this ledge.
A day after the accident, I walked down to Dumpster to check the tracks of the sledge and my skis. The tracks of the skis go straight, the tracks of the sled go about 2 meters to the left and end at a rock that’s pointing out at the edge of the cliff. Most likely Antony hit this rock at very low speed and was stopped immediately. He then hit the first ledge and was knocked out. That would explain why he didn't correct his instability and didn’t pull his parachute.
The police have found his camera and are still trying to watch the footage. If my theory is wrong, we will update this report."

Those intrinsic to alpine jumps: fatigue from a long and technical approach and the added discomfort of jumping with equipment
Backwind - which caused descents and further height loss on the recovery arc
Not being aware of the loss of speed
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE DAY
The plan was to do an alpine jump in Peña Telera, with winter conditions. There was abundant snow in poor conditions that made the approach very uncomfortable. 
We were equipped with winter equipment (ice axe, crampons, sticks, harness and ropes)
It took us about 4 hours to ascend the +1300m.
It was necessary to rappel down about 30m to the exit.
 
CONDITIONS
Exit clear of snow and ice
Strong back wind, but exit fully protected and without wind
Not too cold
 
BACKGROUND
Nacho had a lot of experience in this type of alpine jumps and jumping the climbing equipment, with and without a wingsuit.
He already did that exit several times (the first repetition in slick, flying straight with onesie and flying the right line with swift)
 
The rock drop of the jump is large (250m) although the view is impressive (north face, dark and closed). 
The simplest line for this exit is to fly straight down the channel and open outside. 
There are other lines such as flying to the right and passing at different heights of a shoulder, depending on the suit you are wearing or how high you go. After passing the shoulder, there is a wall that allows you to separate the terrain for the opening and landing on a lake.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT (FLYSIGHT)
We haven't recovered the camera, but we have the flysight information.
 
His original jump plan, which he had done on other occasions, was to fly right over the shoulder, continue flying to pass the separation wall, open and land by the lake. He jumped in last place.
 
Analyzing the flysight data, Nacho jumped and followed that plan, starting the right turn from the very beginning, probably without noticing that he did not have a good start (none of the three of us who jumped with him that day had good numbers at the start, probably due to the wind from the back).
 
From the first moment the FlySight indicates a constant and progressive loss of speed, which Nacho should not have noticed because he continued flying right towards the shoulder instead of aborting the line and redirecting the flight to exit the channel straight. 
 
Once it was over the shoulder, very close to the ground and with no option to change flight line, the suit stalled. Nacho did an emergency pull and the canopy opened onheading and flew for 4s. We could see the canopy fly from the landing. He lost a lot of height before opening due to the stall of the suit and the opening, so he could not fly out of that slope and touched the ground. 
 
We assume that he rolled down the slope without removing zippers, which meant that he could not protect himself in the fall.
 
CONCLUSIONS
Make plan A always as the easiest line to fly. While in flight, we should evaluate if we can enter a more complicated line instead of evaluating if we have to abort to make a simpler plan. We have thousandths of a second to make a decision, if inertia leads us to the simplest plan it is more likely that we can have another opportunity in the future in which we see more clearly entering into a more complicated line. 
 
Fly fast, flying slow is never a good option. 
 
When attacking edges, end up passing a little below the height at which you are going. Doing so will make you gain speed and a safety margin.
 
PARA AMIGOS Y FAMILIA
Fue un día extremadamente feliz, de esos que tenía cada lustro en los que exteriorizaba su buen humor. Durante la subida dijo literalmente: ‘Esto es lo que más me llena’, refiriéndose a ascender una montaña, con condiciones invernales peleonas, con material alpino, acompañado de sus amigos, para luego saltar. 
 
Fue grande no solo por lo que hacía, teniendo una lista infinita de historias vividas que ni el mejor de los guionistas podría imaginar, sino por ser un AMIGO excepcional al que no le hacía falta ni ser simpático para entrar en nuestros corazones."

We started hiking around 11.15am or so. Chill hike talked about nothing in particular on the walk. Once we got to our exit we assessed the conditions and decided it was nice to jump.
Compton told me more about the jump even though we had talked about the jump quite a bit and walked away from it the day before because it was too windy. We geared up and talked about some flying techniques and different suit shapes.
We called to the other 3 jumpers that were jumping a different exit close by that we were ready. They flew past us, I jumped first and Compton was about 5 seconds behind me. I landed and turned around to only see 3 other canopies in the air and knew things were not good.
The others under canopy watching us fly saw what happened and we ran up the mountain to find her, with 1 staying behind to meet SAR. We got to a climbing section that Spencer was comfortable climbing so the 2 of us waited. He found her at rest quickly and waited with her for SAR to get her down.
As she was entering her line she clipped a tree and sent her into a hard downward spiral into the trees. It was quick and probably painless."

Nicolas Gris,FRANCE,43,2024-10-04,,,,,,Switzerland,BASE Fatality,Earth,Object strike under canopy,"Sumo 3, Tracking Suit by Squirrel",Unknown,Unknown,"Slider Up, BOC, BOC","Medium winds, Rain","180 Offheading, Line twists, Not enough forward seperation on exit","We were a group of four jumpers on our way to High Nose. We took the 14:38 gondola from Lauterbrunnen and met Nicolas in the gondola. He told us he was planning to jump Nose 2. He seemed in good spirits, eager to jump after two days of rain. We exchanged telephone numbers to coordinate jumps, as we intended to jump from different exits.
He started the hike alone, a few minutes before us. That was the last time we saw him. All four of us had uneventful jumps. We stashed our gear and started walking towards Lauterbrunnen approximately 10 minutes after jumping.
Just after we started walking, we heard Nicolas’ canopy open. We turned around and saw that he had opened with line twists at a reasonable altitude. In addition to the line twists, he had an off-heading of between 120° and 150° to the right. From the distance, it was hard to tell the exact degree of the off-heading or the number of line twists, but it looked like more than one and above the risers.
After opening, he tried to correct the off heading by turning to the left, but it wasn’t enough, and he hit the cliff the first time. It wasn’t a hard hit, so we were hopeful that he would clear it. But due to an offset on his risers or an input from him, the canopy turned to the right again in a steeper turn. This resulted in a more violent second impact, likely fatal.
From then we didn’t see any further inputs. He fell the remaining 50-60 meters with a collapsing canopy with multiple smaller hits and came to rest at where the forest meets the cliff. Two of us ran to him, arriving in less than 10 minutes, but found him unconscious with no signs of life. We began CPR immediately and continued until the rescue helicopter arrived.
As we didn’t witness the actual jump, we can only speculate on what happened. The distance from the wall after opening suggests he didn’t track very far, but far enough to assume he didn’t fall off the exit unintentionally due to possible wet conditions. We cannot say if there was any camera on this jump. The Helmet had an anti-snag mount, but due to the circumstances we didn’t look closer if there were broken parts on the Helmet.
We don’t have any information about his age, experience of base and skydiving. If you have any information, please feel free to reach out and fill in the gaps. Even though we didn’t know Nicolas, he seemed like a nice and calm person. Our condolences and thoughts are with his family and friends."

Description:
I am sorry to announce the death of Filippo Guenzani (name to be modified if not properly spelled), known as Filippo LeQuerce on Instagram. I wasn’t directly a witness, but I was on site and was called by the PGHM to help provide information to the rescue team about the jump and potential flight lines. I don’t know Filippo nor saw the flight; but I was on another exit 200m south at the time and saw his friends taking off with speed wings.
What we knew while searching for him: He exited around 10h20 alone from the “classic” exit of Varan, followed by his speed flying friends, taking off from the Aiguilles Rouges, above, and who saw him passing below them, then lost visual as they focused on their line. He then was missing at the landing and was not responding on his phone. On the location-sharing app they had initiated before the jump, his phone was somewhere close to the exit.
Weather condition: Blue sky, 10kmh S wind at the exit, I encountered E wind 1400m below.
-His video was recovered by the rescue team, and I could see it, but since they didn’t have software to read the 360 file on site, I could only access a dual fisheye view, which is distorted and couldn’t allow for comfortable analysis, and it needs to be taken into consideration reading what follows : He had a normal and stable exit followed by a safe flight, the line everyone does from the exit to the Ilettes lake (which is the landing). He flew pretty high on a very conservative line, all along. He initiated a flare then a pull 800m before the landing, pretty high according to the video. He couldn’t get anything out and got on his back almost instantly. He managed to get on his belly, then lost control again, then spins downwards to where he hit the ground and remained until the rescue team arrived. Between his first pull attempt and the ground, 14s elapsed, of which 7s spinning down. We could see him attempting again to reach his BOC a couple times but can’t tell if he tried more because of the 360 distortion and the angle of his camera. His pc was found out with a folded bridle, most probably out on impact.
We had a week ago BFL #496 happening a few km away on a national road. 
From what I saw and was told, he most probably was flying an Aura4; he had an adrenalineBase container. I let the ones knowing him, completing the experience section.
I’m really sad for his family and friends; he played it safe until he tried to open his parachute."

I asked him if he was aware of the prior incident at that exit where a very talented jumper had a close call trying to fly out the center of the valley. He was aware of the incident.
The next day he messaged me at 10:39am to say he was looking for the Big Willard Platform exit. By 11:31am he had found the higher exit that has a rope and awkward footing. He shared that he felt the conditions were okay already, but he wanted to wait for boosting updraft. He sent me photos of the spot he was at as well as a lower spot with better footing he found earlier. He shared he intended to go from the higher spot. He sent me a video of another flyer going from the lower exit, flying closer to the center of the valley, and appearing to fly max glide to cross a much lower point on the ridge.
I shared that I thought that pilot missed out on a bunch of available lift by not hugging the wall tighter off exit. At 12:20pm he messaged that he was gearing up to and would be jumping in a minute, and said he would talk to me when he gets down. Jonathan and I had never met in person but he would write to me about his adventures searching for new exits. This was the first time he had messaged indicating that he would check in upon landing; I was surprised but told him to enjoy his flight. At 12:42pm I sent him an “All good?”.
At 1:12pm I called his employer but did not receive an answer. At 1:14pm I called a good friend of his to check if there was anyone else he might message to inform about a jump. At 1:21pm I received a call back from his employer and explained I was trying to find if there was anyone else he would normally message about his jump that I could double check with before calling the Willard police. During that call we agreed it was time and would not hurt to call the police. I called the police at 1:32pm and relayed what happened and that he might be injured in the canyon.
Simultaneously, his employer contacted local search and rescue via a staff member who participates on SAR. A friend and co-worker located his car by roughly 2pm without a sign of Jonathan. He then communicated he would begin traveling up the canyon to search for Jonathan. I made a diagram of three possible flight paths Jonathan may have taken and sent it to the Willard Sergeant and Jonathan’s employer who had contact with SAR.
At 3:30pm I received a call from the Willard Sergeant indicating they had a bird in the air searching for Jonathan. I looked through his videos and found a screen grab of what was likely the canopy he’d have used for this flight, and sent a description of his mountain wingsuit to the Willard Sergeant and his employer who had contact with SAR. His coworker called me at 8:17pm to indicate that Jonathan had been found deceased and recovered via hoist. I received a separate call from a police officer at 8:55pm informing me of the same and they had recovered video and watched the video.
A description of the video should be included here once a jumper has reviewed the video:�� <TO BE COMPLETED>� While waiting for Jonathan’s message, I checked the forecast and weather report for the exit.
Winds were reported at 5-6kmh out of the west with gusts up to 21kmh. The ideal wind for this exit is out of the southwest. The ridge to crossover runs on the southwest to northeast line and the critical crossover section of that ridge is an east-facing wall. It’s possible Jonathan had a sight picture showing him clearing the ridge and then hit cool sinky air from west wind just before crossing the ridge.
Jonathan had recently been opening exits in Lamoille and the Wasatch and was flying proficiently. This exit requires specific conditions to safely reach the main landing area and the ability to be decisive about committing to a ridge crossover or a parachute deployment over rough terrain.
While Jonathan was a talented flyer, it’s likely he would have benefited from more experience before attempting this flight to inform the intuition needed for making such a quick judgement call off exit."
Phillippe Richter,FRANCE,55,2024-09-21,,,,,,France,BASE Fatality,Earth,Mis-pull,"Freak, Expert Wingsuit by Squirrel",Unknown,Unknown,"Slider Up, BOC, BOC","Sunny, Winds light and variable","Altitude awareness, Unable to locate pilot chute","Philippe had a clean exit.
He had a clean flight.
He flew in direction of the main road.
He didn't pull his pilot chute.
He impacted full speed, on the main road, in the dense traffic.
Philippe is dead on impact.
People are under shock.
Mostly the lady who had to violently pull not to drive on his body.
Or the two shaken up fire fighters with ten years of duty, who described to me the action of going for a heart massage, and the dread of feeling the concrete directly through Philippe's thorax... Or the sensation of taking him out of his wingsuit, feeling every bone of him, shattered every 2 cm.
That. And more.
That is not intended to be a trial against Philippe. Who was a delightful human being I am sure of that.
This is intended to be a warning against dangerous behaviours that go against all base jumping ethics. That are killing the sport and have risked to kill inocent lives all together.
That is written to try waking up people from the denial illness that is spreading out without control in this activity.
As it has been stated before, Philippe has been warned multiple time for his impreparation by many experienced jumpers.
Last occurence was on a long facebook debate 3 weeks ago. (On the french PIAF page).
Philippe was around 90 basejumps old in 4 years, almost all slick and slider off, when he decided to jump a Freak wingsuit.
He declared 200 wingsuit skydives.
He has been admitted to a base jumping wingsuiting course in June this year and began to jump his freak in the mountains.
He jumped in Norway, Brento and Lauterbrunnen, allegedly totalizing 40 recent WS flights.
Then he arrived in Magland a few days ago and had his accident on his second day (and flight) from here (tête Louis Philippe).
Magland is much more technical than what he was used to. It is alltogether shorter, more positive, the terrain is visually present and civilisation is right there under. (Main road, highway, train line plus electrical cables)
In the precipitation Philippe most likely didn't find his pilote chute, panicked, never found it, and hit the ground.
There is much more to say on all that story. Like for example how Saturday was the local annual feast in Magland, and our base jump association was to take a stand there, to meet the citizens and inform on all the energy we are putting on making the sport safer and the cohabitation neater...
Since the accident implies the public area, the Prefect has been informed. The legal consequences are yet to be known.
In one year 3 men died here in Magland.
All three people didn't listen to the warnings of the experienced jumpers.
Please listen to the warnings.
Experienced jumpers have seen people die.
They recognise the patterns.
The patterns don't lie.
Please inform yourself with local jumpers on dangers and flight trajectories for each new exit. Read the website, talk to people. Learn the ethics.
Surround yourself with healthy OG jumpers.
Remember that going in will have heavy consequences on your family, your friends, the rescue team, the sport, etc.
Rest in peace Philippe. We send our most sincere condolences to your friends, wife and family.
We are sad."

The first half of the day we spent just hiking to the exit with no gear. I just wanted to laser a few points and check everything out. We then spent the majority of the day eating too much food in town and hanging around the landing area until around sunset time. Which is when the winds had finally calmed down.
At around 6:30pm Monday, we made our first jump at Forcellino. Winds were inconsistent but manageable. After some time on exit myself and 2nd jumper did a 2-way flying high and just getting a feel for the area. Kimball exited next, followed by another wingsuiter and finally a onesie.
Upon opening I realized Kimball was substantially lower and landing before me even though I had previously exited 1-2 minutes prior. I didn't think much of it as I was focused on the landing area and making sure everyone had made it safe.
That evening we all went for dinner together and spoke about going to sleep early so we could wake up, eat and make 2 jumps the following day.
The Next Day: We started the morning at around 10:30am at a coffee shop in Lecco to eat pastries and coffee. We were in absolutely no rush to get to the exit as the conditions were perfect, there were no winds which was a relief as yesterday we were not so lucky. After finishing up. We set out to stage Kimball's car at the landing area and drive up in one car all together for this first load. After about a 30 minute drive to the top of Piani Resinelli parking lot. We got all of our gear and then began the hike at around 12:10pm. We arrived at the exit point at around 12:35pm having taken our time and just talked the whole hike up.
Upon getting to the exit point. The great conditions were a relief in comparison to yesterday. We were stoked and so grateful to all be at this exit point together in Italy. After thinking about the process of gearing up and talking about our plan for the jump it now occurs to me that Kimball had not said much, other than he wanted to fly left and go for his own line.
The 1st jumper of our group was slider off who I pca'd. Then Kimball was the second to exit in front of me. He had a slightly head high exit but was flying left pretty swiftly in about 2 seconds from having exited.
From there I could no longer see him. I proceeded to gear up and talk about our flight plan and exit as I was doing a 2 way with another jumper. Our plan was just to get together, do some freestyle and pull high above the landing area. Once I was under canopy, I saw the 4th and final wingsuiter's exit flight and deployment.
After looking around I saw everyone coming into land but was not aware of Kimball's canopy because I thought he had already landed. Upon landing it had set in that something was wrong and Kimball's location was unknown. No one had seen his canopy. About 20-30 minutes of no contact with Kimball I decided to call the emergency line and a helicopter arrived about 30 minutes later. The search took a long time involving communication with the helicopter to try and pinpoint where he was with FindmyPhone as well a thermal scanner and an additional crew on foot. At around 4pm it was confirmed they had found kimball.
Kimball had not been to this jump before except for the evening prior. Kimball had not looked at any previous videos, google earth or any other tools before the first jump. After coming across the video of his previous flight and the way he flew the first jump with such little awareness of the actual terrain below it was hard to understand what more he wanted to do on this jump.
Kimball spoke about cutting his trip short and getting back to the US. Which leads me to believe this was one of the last jumps of his trip here and it might have influenced the way he flew. Based on the 360 footage from the slider down jumper who had exited before Kimball, he can be seen making a quick left turn, traversing across as high as possible without maintaining much speed. Seemed like he was almost at the stall point, but just barely makes it over the second ridge. Same ridge as the previous day but significantly higher. He then proceeds to make a right turn that cost him everything. It seemed like he was relying on the potential steepness of terrain to relieve him of his glide over to the second ridge.
After about 6 seconds of having made the right turn, pretty blind to what was coming next Kimball can be seen impacting and then disappearing behind the ridge.
The major failures this day:
1. Jumping an exit for the first time and flying a flat highly committed line. Not much more he could do on his second jump there.
2. Kimball was willing to take risks and seemed okay with the unknown.
3. Kimball chose to jump into a situation where he hoped it would all work out in his favour without having any repetition or consistency.
4. This was probably around Kimball's 20th wingsuit base jump. Not aware of this until now.
5. I should have been more aware of his flying and wish I had spoken with him about his flight plan before ever walking up to that exit.
Still currently dealing with the local police to retrieve the footage of his last jump from his GoPro to give more a detailed report.
Kimball is one of the nicest people I have ever met, and it felt like there wasn't a single thing you couldn't talk about with him. He was as real as they come and it is a shame to see complacency and lack of preparation get someone so capable."

Name: James Allen
Date: September 8, 2024
Location: Limska Draga Bridge
Experience:
Over 1,500 skydives
25 BASE jumps
Equipment Used:
BASE gear: Hybrid Alien, OSP 2, 285
Full-face helmet: Cookie G4 (CE rated)
Hiking boots
Background:
The jumper was an experienced skydiver and current BASE jumper. Earlier in the day, he performed a successful Pilot Chute Assist (PCA) jump under good weather conditions, executing a clean exit and demonstrating good canopy control from opening to landing.
This was his third time jumping at Limska Draga Bridge and his second visit to the site this year. He was preparing for an upcoming jump in Italy at Monte Brento in a few days.
Incident Details:
Time of fatal jump: 16:16
Weather:Overcast with a low-pressure system approaching
Mild crosswind at the exit point
Light catabatic wind at landing
Conditions were considered safe for jumping
The jumper exited the bridge with a handheld pilot chute, performing a one-second delay. His exit was stable and textbook, with a proper release of the pilot chute and a controlled body position during the opening sequence. The canopy deployed at the correct altitude, with a slight 15-degree off-heading to the right, directly above the landing area.
Canopy Flight and Impact:
Upon opening, the jumper had the canopy in a deep brake configuration. After releasing the toggles, the canopy surged, and he initiated a strong left-hand toggle turn, veering away from the landing area and towards a gravel road. He continued the left turn, resulting in an aggressive 270-degree rotation before impact.
At the 180-degree point of the turn, his legs brushed lightly against a tree. By the 270-degree mark, he impacted the edge of the road and rocks, with the canopy settling in nearby bushes. The final 90 degrees of the turn occurred at a very fast speed.
Immediate Response:
Within 10 seconds, a ground crew member reached him and began administering first aid while calling for an ambulance.
The jumper was conscious but in shock, clutching his left leg. Initial assessment indicated a likely broken left femur and a fractured right wrist, with feeling still present in both legs. He reported difficulty breathing but did not appear to be in immediate respiratory distress. There was concern about possible internal injuries due to the severe impact.
The ambulance arrived within 20 minutes, and paramedics took over care. Upon examination, they found no signs of broken ribs or external bruising to suggest internal injuries. He remained conscious as he was placed on a stretcher and transported to the hospital.
Outcome:
Later, it was reported that the jumper had passed away. The cause of death is still pending the results of an autopsy. This report will be updated once that information becomes available.
Conclusion:
Although the crosswind at the exit was mild, the jumper had indicated plans to make a left turn to avoid the trees on the right side. He was offered a PCA, which he declined. From the initial canopy surge after releasing the toggles to the moment of impact, it appears the jumper was focused on returning to the main landing area and continued turning despite the increasing aggressiveness of the maneuver.
In summary, the jumper’s decision to continue the turn led to a high-speed impact, commonly referred to as ""hooking it in.”"

Felipe Álvarez (Fiyi),SPAIN,43,2024-08-23,5,400,100,200,,Spain,BASE Fatality,Earth,Emergency Pull,"Freak, Expert Wingsuit by Squirrel","Vision, 7 Cell - Vented by Atair Aerodynamics","LD4, 2 Pin by Adrenalin BASE","Slider Up, BOC, BOC",Winds light and variable,Emergency low pull,"We started the hike at 6:30h, reaching the top at 10:30h. Conditions were perfect, the wall is facing east so we had already good thermals.
 
The exit is at the top of a high and vertical wall, right at the center of a big bowl from an antic glacier circus. The jump can be broken down in two key sections, where the main landings are located. The first part involves an 800m long flat section with different good landing options, this is where you land after a tracksuit jump. The second section requires crossing an uphill talus and a forest area to reach bigger landing zones, closer to where the car is parked.
 
We discussed with Fiyi the flight patterns and the different landing options he could probably reach. Basically, before or after a trees/forest section with a higher hill in between. The second section would require flying along/near the left wall, this way the flight distance would be shorter but also taking advantage of the lift generated by the thermals.
 
Fiyi had previously jumped in this location with the tracksuit, landing in the first section. Being this the most conservative option in case of bad exit or lack of performance during flight.
 
Fiyi jumped at 10:50am, having a clean and symmetrical exit. However, seconds later he started flattening out, losing gradually the forward speed. He also flew through the middle of the valley, not taking advantage of the wall thermals but also increasing the flight distance to reach any landing from the second section. After 12 seconds we lost visual contact with him, assuming he would have reached the second section, or some small landings in the area.
 
We tried to contact Fiyi, but there was no phone signal in the area, then we waited about 1.5h near the village, which is the time it normally takes to walk down from any intermediate landing. Then, we walked up to find him expecting he had a bad landing and could be stuck in tree. After 1h of searching and not getting any response from him we called the emergency services. It took them about 2-3h to find his body wrapped with his canopy. Fiyi impacted in the forest area, right in between the two main landing zones. The injuries of the impact caused an instant death, as per the emergency services feedback.
 
Fiyi’s camera hasn’t been found yet, however other ground images revealed that he managed to pull seconds before the impact, right after crossing the hill before the forest.
 
Route cause of the accident:
 
Fiyi didn’t have yet the experience to assess the speed range of the suit, nor to realize he was flying too close to the stall point. Also, didn’t take advantage of the thermals close to the wall, which also made him fling the longer distance to reach the distant landing areas. But the most important part is that he lacked complete awareness of the safety altitude, being probably too much focused on reaching the second landing area of the jump.
 
Fiyi was a great and unique individual, lovely person with high energy and motivation. He will be very much missed. Fly free my friend.

Weather condition was great, sunny, no wind, the cliff was half in the sun and half in the shade.
His exit was good, after 3 seconds he was in full flight and after another 2 seconds he started to set the left turn to go on the line. 12 seconds after the exit he disappeared from sight beyond the mountain. Based on where his body was found, we discover that he decided to go pass on the left side of one tower that is on the left flight line.
This tower makes a gate to enter in a steep trench on the right side. To enter in this line it's necessary to be high enough to set a proper right turn. We suppose that he arrived too low at the gate entrance to make the right turn. The impact with the rocks just after the gate was inevitable.
This line is a technical line that needs a good flight plan, probably he set the left turn too late and this decision got him too low at the gate entrance. He did two jumps from this spot last year with his Onesie power, flying the left line, outside the tower. He was a good Onesie pilot.
This jump was the first jump for him from this spot with a wingsuit. We don't know if it could be relevant for the dynamic of this fatality, but in his previous jump he had complained about problems with the helmet visor fogging up. We can exclude no hypotheses till when the video from his helmet will be analyzed."

There was a group of 6. Everyone was very excited as 5 of us had never done the jump before, Raian was leading us to the exit as he had done it a few times before.
When we arrived around 10 am, it was very light to dead winds, got sunny as we got to the top and everyone was stoked. Raian was relatively quiet on the hike up but gave us the info we needed on exit. He geared up pretty quickly and was ready to jump first. He said have a good jump to us all and went first.
His exit was quite head high, pendulumed head down and had a bad start what was as normal for Raian what we didn’t know at this stage however he flew right out of sight and we didn’t hear from him again. The next 5 of us jumped about a minute apart.
Only 2 of the remaining 5 made it through the V line (both in Corvid 2’s). We both had good exits and quick starts, and still the conditions didn’t allow for much healthy margin. With a bad exit, I believe it would have been nearly impossible to make the hard flight in the conditions given. (Shaded wall and first time on this line in the C BASE). As we flew overhead through the V, we saw his body resting on the top of the second main impact point through the gulley.
No canopy out, laying flat with head up as though he had stalled out right as he impacted. We just met Raian the day before in Sass Pordoi. He was very kind and fun to hang out with a very good dude! Was hoping to get some epic jumps in with him over our last few days here in Europe. He will be missed for sure, I think anyone who has been lucky enough to hang out with Raian will miss him, a great energy to have in the group.
From a close Friend: Raian was a special person. Really a good soul and always make me smile. 75% off all his jumps I jumped with him. No one knew him better then me. He had many problems with speed on his flying. Thats why he bought a C-Base to solve this problem. But he took this suit for every jump. Short exits. Glidy flights however we talked many month about it and he know his problems with head low exits and flying slow. However fix your problems with training and not just changing a suit. Use the suit for the terrain and glide you fly. You where an amazing human. We love you and thank you for everything! On our way we did together."

B. was a member of our Intermediate Wingsuit BASE Camp in Loen, Norway. He was a very experienced BASE jumper and wanted to improve his exits and performance. Throughout the first few days of the course, his exits had not been great but manageable in the relative safety of Loen. We had been working with him with multiple methods to improve the stability and consistency of his starts, with moderate improvement. On the morning of May 17, we planned to take the course on a hike to a mountain named Saksa. It had been jumped once by a local Norwegian and was reported to have a “9 second rock drop”. None of the instructors had been to the mountain before. We thought it would be a good exercise in site evaluation for the students, and a beautiful hike.
B. was in great spirits as we started the hike at 5am with the intention of jumping before 10am. We added plenty of time to take the hike slow, but he was at the head of the pack. As we reached the summit of the mountain and began scouting for potential exits, we did not find anything close to a “9 second rock drop”. After splitting from the group, Espen and I began looking for something that would work. We found 2 potential exits with vertical numbers in the 170 meter range (with steep terrain below). On top of that, the terrain just opposite of the exit was raised requiring a 30 degree right hand turn shortly after inflation. We agreed that the exit was only acceptable for a few students with consistent exits. Another experienced jumper who had joined us for the hike jumped first, radioing up accurate interpretation of his flight. The entire scene became quite chaotic with some jumpers gearing up and others preparing to walk down. We discussed at length that exit was not suitable if their exits were not dialed and discussed the visual aspect of the jump, detailing the profile and the risks. We informed everyone that we would walk down with anyone who chose not to jump. We had ample food and water and weather was perfect. B. was very fast to gear up and suddenly appeared over my shoulder on exit ready to jump as I was discussing conditions with another student. Another instructor was in the process of gearing up to go first but he insisted that he was ready. B.’s exit was quite steep with asymmetric and kicking legs, he tried to correct and turn right but it looked like he panicked, bent his legs, and dug in his arms. His suit stalled almost immediately, and he impacted shortly after an emergency pitch at 7 seconds.
I have known B. for 10 years; he was a good friend. The major failures of the day were as follows:
1. Expectations did not meet reality for the day, and B. was expecting to jump.
2. The chaos in the 30 minutes of exit point searching and movement around the mountain created a lot of room for errors in analysis and judgement.
3. B. chose to jump into a situation he hoped he would perform perfectly, without enough repetition and consistency.
4. Experience or confidence gained over 10 years ago should not equate to modern wing suit jumps."

He was a super nice guy and I enjoyed hearing some of his stories from when he started learning to skydive in the 80s.
He told me he wanted to jump Courthouse rock as a bucket list item and was happy that he finally had climbing friends to help him climb the face and take his gear down for him after he jumped. He invited me on the jump weeks in advance and seemed pretty confident with the exit point beta he gathered…
I never got to follow up with him about his currency or look up more details about the exit, like I would have wanted to, I decided not to go and quite frankly didn’t know if they were even still planning on going out that day. Unfortunately, Kenn died on this jump. I was contacted later by the climber and was sent the video to analyse what happened...
Kenn was in an original prodigy suit with a Velcro rig. In the video he looked extremely tired from the long climb/hike to the exit. It was also one of the first hot days this season so I’m sure that didn’t help with his fatigue. When he exited he had a solid push but after the first second he started drifting to the left a bit. There is a talus below the exit at about 800 ft that continues outwards to jumpers left… Instead of pitching or attempting to pitch as the talus got closer, he just kept going and tried to fly the suit… Kenn impacted the talus with nothing out at about 7.5 seconds. It honestly looked like he got object fixated, once his body was heading towards the rock, and he just froze. There was not any attempt at pitching at all… which is pretty hard to comprehend.
I believe that Kenn underestimated what this particular jump entailed and how much fatigue and being uncurrent can have a huge impact on decision making. Lessons learned: This jump is a technical wingsuit jump or a slider down exit. There is not much in-between. Kenn was the only base jumper on this jump with a bunch of climber friends who cannot be a resource to him when looking at the exit, the flight, lzs, gear checks… anything. He also didn’t ask many questions before hand. Somehow, I ended up being his only base contact in the sport and in our brief conversation a month before he went to do this, he didn’t ask me for any extra info and seemed confident in his approach to the jump. I had no idea what suit he was going to be jumping or what he was thinking doing this exit after such a long hiatus…
At the end of the day, it’s our responsibility to know what we are getting ourselves into… do the homework, ask questions, use your peers to talk about jump plans and stay current. Kenn was a great guy and will be missed."

Description:
Hayley was last at Brento 5 years ago and she was about to do her 100th base jump here. She had recently been practicing object avoidance at the bridge in Croatia the days prior. We also talked about correcting heading before getting out of twists while gearing up for this jump.
Her previous jump from Brento was only a sub 5 second delay with slow slider. She said she needed to get more airspeed for better separation in her track. Her exit was great, good transition but then another short delay and high opening and I didn't see her canopy come out into the bowl. I don't know if it was just a 180 or line twists as well.
I heard an impact and some rock fall and thought that was it. I called ground control. A few minutes later she called me, sounding concerned but not in pain or desperate. She sounded calm considering the circumstances, she said she was feeling dizzy and needs to put down the phone.
That was the last I heard from her. From some distant rear camera footage, it looks like there was very little input made to avoid the cliff, I can only think she possibly froze or just didn't react quick enough. She was a lovely person to be around and was taking steps towards her aspirations and goals within base fully aware of her limitations and the aspects she needed to improve on.
A message from the Skydive Vancouver Island community. Haley was not only a friendly face at our DZ, but she was also family to many of our close friends on the mainland. Her sweetness and warmth will always be cherished in our hearts. She was passionate about our sport and creating a sense of community by ensuring everyone felt welcome. She was a very active member of CSPA Women’s Initiatives Committee and an advocate in our sport and her career for inclusion and support services.

Equipment inspection report
Date of incident: Mar 15 - Mar 17, 2024
Incident: fatality
Parachutist: William Mitchell
Temperature: Unknown, wearing multiple layers appropriate for cold
Winds: unknown
Time of the day: approx. – unknown, speculative very early morning/night
Inspection has been conducted on the following equipment:
Parachute: Unknown at this time, Squirrel Manufacturing from blue
bartacks seen.
Harness/Container: Squirrel CIRRUS
-Visual inspection minimal invasion of key components- pending full gear inspection.
Facts collected by inspection of the equipment/parachutist:
1. The parachutists left lower container, front/side thigh, and side area clothing and rig appeared to have taken first impact. The container fabric layers around the left lateral harness/backpack/side flap peeling apart appearing to be “Blown out.”
2. The parachutist’s container pin cover flap was tightly closed top to bottom, no lifting of the edge at bottom of closing flap.
3. The closing pin (closest to the pilot chute) was free from the closing loop, bottom closing loop was undamaged.
4. After Detectives carefully opened the pin cover flap under guidance- the Top closing pin (pin closest to parachutist’s head) was still inside the closing loop, 99% extracted but still lying 100% flat on its side. This pin was free to move and popped free shortly after inspection.
5. The pilot chute was not in the BOC (Bottom of container) pouch and bridle was attached correctly and at full extension. The fold creases for the excess between pins was still crisply visible but unfolded, and the routing to canopy was still neatly tucked away into container as per Manufactures instruction.
6. The last 2 feet of bridle before pilot chute was cut cleanly during recovery as it was suspended below the waters surface at full extension acting as an anchor.
7. The bottom flap was folded open 3/4, with only the “bottomless corners” container feature holding the containers bottom shaping.
8. The parachutists right “ear” of the parachute packjob was neatly unfolded from the container, but the individual layers were still compressed together. Upon visual inspection of this small portion, the proper pieces of fabric (canopy Nose and nose support tape) were visually confirmed to be in the correct orientation for a working pack job.
9. Pilot chute and last 2 feet of bridle was inspected and measured without and apparent damage, and PC properly connected. PC was a 46” non vented pilot chute with a Cordura patch handle, older but in good condition.
Observations and inspection information:
1. Fact 2 and ground tests suggest-that the pilot chute was never deployed in freefall. The pin cover flap was tucked fully and very snugly into position with no evidence the bridle had tried to deploy behind the parachutist in freefall. The flap could have been bumped closed during the recovery/transport/storage, but as I and detective McRoberts noticed, it was a snug fit (not overly tight), with specific pressure points to close the low-profile pin cover flap back after inspection. The other thing it suggests could be possible is that the pilot chute was deployed at an EXTREMELY low altitude, less than the length of the bridle.
2. Taking many of the facts into account, as well as information from Detective McRoberts about the recovery and the deceased body position on arrival of recovery crew- It likely suggests the pilot chute could have acted as an anchor, slowly removing the bottom pin straight out the bottom of the pin cover flap when the deceased was removed from the water before the bridle was cut. Extraction at this straight vertical angle wouldn’t pry up the pin cover flap at the bottom edge as it would from a belly to earth deployment, or a “Pin locked” container.
3. The way the parachutist impacted the water could explain how the pilot chute was removed from the BOC pouch.
4. The 46” Non vented pilot chute is 4” larger the typical size used for jumping an object of such height as the Perrine Bridge. Hanging below parachutist in the water at full bridle length would present substantial hindrance to recovery efforts as it would have a very high surface area and drag when pulled on from above.
Plenty of force to allow pin to be extracted as the rig was lifted from water.
5. If the bridle entangled the parachutist, often there are visual streaks of burn marks on any exposed skin it contacted. With the parachutists’ multiple layers of clothing, it’s likely it would have left no evidence. No burn streaks or marks seen, but the bridle was wet at time of inspection and could be hiding.
Personal opinion and conclusion.
After considering all the information available and trying to reproduce the facts/results as well as other ground test examples, I do not believe the pilot chute was ever removed by the parachutist before impacting the water.
I don’t professionally think that facts 8 and 7 are possible if the parachutist deployed before impact. If the canopy folds had been exposed to the water current for any period, the fabric folds wouldn’t have been cleanly creased and folded still. This is a common sign that a parachute has been packed inside the container under tension for a longer period before being opened.
If the bottom flap was opened pre-recovery and exposed and flapping in the light current for any significant period, the canopy would not still be neatly folded fully seated, it most likely would have slid down (even a little), potentially completely out of the container.
The bottom pin holds most of the tension, without it a canopy will typically fall out onto the ground. I do believe the pilot chute was most likely removed by the impact force/position on impact, allowing the pilot chute to sink and the drag in water to open the bottom pin of the container accidentally during recovery efforts.
This would explain why the pin cover flap wasn’t opened slightly at the bottom edge, as well as why the top pin wasn’t in the “standing” position vs lying flat."

Ale was a wonderful guy, still dreaming like a kid, he was a professional long-range pilot, he had a long skydive and base-jumping background, he was the kind of jumper that underestimates his skills, always conservative with good mindset, he never pushed hard in his way of flying.
Ale was super kind, gentle and a humble human being. My thoughts go to his family, his friends, his colleagues, his son and lucky jumpers that have crossed paths with him.
Details
It was a solo jump, a friend of his drove him up to the top of the mountain and while Ale was hiking to the exit his friend drove the car down to the landing zone. Ale texted his friend that he would jump in 2 minutes. His friend never had Ale in sight, but a speleologist (cave diver scientist) has reported to authorities that he saw a wingsuit spinning and never saw it exiting from the valley. Rescue team was called immediately, helicopter operations took about one hour, Ale was found dead.
Considering all the information that we have at this stage, information's by climbers who were close to the area, videos on TV news and GPS points of possible impact, we could assume that it was a “MISSPULL”. He used to fly “normal” lines, never aggressive, never low passes. Probably he missed the PC, we suppose he lost stability attempting another pull, wingsuit went unstable starting spinning without control. Probably he has impacted in full speed spinning down, he was found close to the last cliff close to landing zone, where we use to start flare or splitting formations.
Canopy was found close to container and PC probably is still in the BOC. Camera was found completely unserviceable, no SD card found. With no videos we could not be sure about what has happened, but we think we are close to the truth. We could consider many factors that could contributed in this Base fatality, but I think it would be disrespectful. I would just say a thing, just my 2 cents that was “philosophy” we share in our “base career”: go jumping conservative, with good friends, with good vibes, when you are happy. I’ve never met people who didn’t have a good word for Ale! Ale you will be missed a lot. Fly free in your infinite skies!"

Nathan had 1 year of experience and has done atleast 10-15 static lines previously but this habit of gearing up with the bridle outside of the boc has inevitably killed him."

In honour of my brother life! The truth shall come out. Other jumpers jumped after this accident that was a TWO WAY , the wrong briefed jump was to do a gainer above Jorge, Jorge did a nice long delay and was flying on heading and safe when the other jumper got entangled in the bridle and fell on top of Jorges parachute causing a malfunction and not reopening. Jorge fell 60 meters to the talus dying instantaneously while the other jumper got unentangled and flew to the landing zone with no issues.
Jorge was a special kind of human being. He’ll be missed strongly by his family and friends.
Original report from jumpers
This jump was a three way with all jumpers jumping slider down. Jorge jumps first and has a short delay with canopy opening and no issue. The second jumper does a gainer and when pitching has his bridle and pc entangled around his body this causes his delay to be longer than the first jumper and he then impacts into Jorges's canopy.
At this time the second jumpers bridle wrap becomes untangled, and his canopy opens, and he flies away, but Jorge's canopy has issues and doesn't reopen, and Jorge impacts below exit a hundred feet below killing him instantly.
Third jumper jumps straight after but has no issues with previous two jumpers.
The Brazilian community and surfing community will deeply miss Jorge with his great personality and always excited to be jumping and surfing."

He was even saying that he wanted to stop jumping that suit and that he was waiting for a new one. We took the gondola up to Mürren at 15:38. While gearing up, Thor started saying: “I have to fix my exits!”, then he went down to the ramp to go for a solo. On the ramp he checked his gear and his pilot chute. He said: “Okay guys” and jumped. From my perspective Thor had a weak push with bended knees and he immediately went very head low - almost going for a front flip. We heard two soft impacts and didn’t see him in his wingsuit or under canopy. As we all planned to fly far left, we decided to jump and look out for him. After landing we tried to call him. Then we got a call from Air-Glaciers asking if everything was alright. A construction worker witnessed Thor’s accident and asked the helicopter rescue for help. The rescue team found Thor on the ground in a straight line down from the ramp. As soon as we’re getting his footage, we will know more. One lesson is already clear: Never jump a technical exit when you’re not feeling a hundred percent confident. If you’re having a series of bad launches, practice from more forgiving exits."

This timing was intentional to avoid jumping into the shaded areas and to ensure better conditions. We were both well aware of the technicalities of the thermal activity and local conditions in the area. Our plan was similar to the previous day, but it was always contingent on the conditions we encountered. We were cautious about potential downdrafts after the exit, even with an updraft present at the exit point.
My plan was to either proceed with the higher planned line, taking into account the exit performance, or to abort and opt for the line with a larger safety margin. In the worst-case scenario, I would abort and fly around the Ridgeline. We exited at 16:36 with a slight thermic updraft. Shortly after exiting, I noticed that the conditions were not as favourable as the previous day, likely due to the presence of a downdraft out from the terrain. Consequently, I decided to abort the higher planned line and used my speed to transition onto the snow barrier line, maintaining more energy as a buffer.
Upon reviewing my 360-degree camera footage, it became evident that Dawid had a deeper start arc than me but used his speed to regain altitude and catch up. However, just before we were to make the turn onto the snow barrier line, he chose to abort and veered to the right of the entire Ridgeline. His earlier manoeuvre to regain altitude had depleted his forward speed, which became apparent in the video footage. As I continued into the line, he disappeared behind the trees.
Approximately three seconds down the line and through a gap in the trees, I could still see him flying on the other side of the ridge. However, his trajectory was losing forward speed and altitude rapidly. Upon closer examination of his impact location and his last position on the video, it seemed that he either stalled his wingsuit while attempting to maintain the glide from the turn and initiated an emergency pull, or he attempted to align with the slope of the terrain to regain speed but was unable to do so, ultimately impacting the ground without a parachute.
I've known Dawid since his FJC in 2019. He displayed a strong motivation and talent right from the start, particularly in his passion for chasing people. He excelled in this pursuit and became skilled at it, with a substantial portion of his 1476 BASE jumps in the past four years involving such camera work, either in a 2-piece or a wingsuit in mountains.
Dawid was a person who radiated happiness and positivity. He was well-liked by everyone who had the pleasure of meeting him, and he served as a jumping partner to many while being a friend to all. It's difficult for me to put into words the profoundly positive impact he had not only on me but also on countless others. I miss you already."

This was Reed’s third time in the region, and 6th-8th jump from this exit. There was a 5-10 mph quartering-headwind (South/Southwest) on the exit with long lulls, and lots of lift coming up the face. We jumped, and Reed flew a high line over the prominent ridge to the right (notated in black). I hugged the ridge, stayed low, and flew the traditional terrain line (notated in red) after coming around the corner. We watched our videos that night, and he had approached his chosen line with plenty of altitude and was able to dive down onto the terrain with (what appeared to me as) ample margin and lots of speed. We planned on doing 3-4 jumps the next day and caught the second gondola to Glacier 3000 on the morning of the 6th.
Jump:
That morning, we arrived on the exit point around 10:50 and jumped by 11:15. It was 62 degrees (the prominent ridge/meadows above had been in direct sunlight for at least an hour and a half), and while a 1-5 mph crosswind (Southeast) was forecasted, there was no wind on the exit. I jumped first, had a mediocre exit and start, and was noticeably lower than the day before. After flying a variation of yesterday’s line, landing safely, and watching the second jumper land 3-5 minutes after me, I stowed my gear and waited for Reed. About 10 minutes after he failed to appear, I called him twice, and we used the iPhone’s “Find my Friend” feature to approximate his location. We immediately called Search and Rescue, gave them the coordinates, and his body was located on the upper ridge (near the beginning of the line he had previously flown the day prior).
A picture provided by Search and Rescue showed a balled-up canopy near Reed, and a bridle/PC fully stretched and tensioned in the direction of travel, suggesting a low, emergency deployment.
Cameras have not been recovered yet, and the Fly Site is currently in police custody.
Flying across that ridge is something I’ve been warned about before, and I know that Reed had received the same advice from more experienced jumpers. While his previous video of that line looked subjectively “safe”, the wind/thermic conditions appear to have been considerably better."

He came into packing room to ask me to jump the high nose with him. We have been doing exactly same kind of 2-way tracking jumps from high nose many times before.
Suit what he was using was new for him and he was happy because he had made couple good tracking jumps with it. He was in good mood on the hike. We had fun and lot of laughs. It started to rain just a bit on the hike and in gear up we were talking should we wait if the rain goes away but we were looking that it might get worse and both of us were fine to jump in little rain.
Joonas had some kind of sunglasses what I have seen him wearing on other jumps and he asked me:” what do you think are these going to fly off during the jump?” I said:” I don't know, maybe it can fall off if you have hard opening or something” We planned to do 2-way. Joonas took the exit from the ramp, and I was on the cliff on right side of the ramp. We agreed that Joonas will jump and fly little to the left and I will stay on the right side.
Joonas made the count and we exited exactly at the same time. He had great start and started to track right away. He slightly turned to the right in flight, and we were pretty close to each other, but I was all the time on right side and little above him, so he did not see me in flight. When it was time to pull, he was little behind and below me. When I pulled and my canopy was open, I saw him tracking past from the left side little below me.
Then he reaches his hand to his pilot chute and start falling more down. He holds his hand on the PC about for a second and then pulls. Pilot chute inflates and canopy comes out at the same time when he crashes to the tree beside the road. Canopy did not inflate. It was full speed impact."

Jay was the first of three jumpers to exit Powerlines in Cortina, in the Italian Dolomites on the morning of September 6. Prior to the jump we had a discussion on the exit point about the line and it was agreed that this jump was well within our experience limits and nothing out of the ordinary in relation to other exits completed this season.
The flysight / laser data was also assessed and was well within our margin. After discussing the jump, which was new for all participants, Jay decided to go first; he exited at 09:46am. His exit was filmed and looked good, however, it was observed that he pushed from approximately 20 cm back from the edge during the exit, which was unusual behaviour for Jay. This deviation did not seem to impact his sub-terminal performance and approximately 3 seconds after his exit, Jay was in flight and appeared to be actively manoeuvring to get into the intended line. However, 8 seconds after his exit, Jay tragically impacted the terrain without deploying his pilot chute. Like a true gentleman.
We did not jump and notified mountain rescue. Probable Cause of the Incident. Based on the available information, it is believed that Jay misjudged the position of a large boulder to the right of the line while making a left turn into the intended flight path shortly after the exit. His camera was recovered however the data is corrupted. Jay's Experience and Condition: Jay was experienced and current in the sport and throughout the season he displayed strong flying skills and a good understanding of the required flight characteristics for Wingsuit BASE and terrain flying.
His decision to exit first that day indicates his confidence in the jump. Jay was seen by many as an experienced Wingsuit BASE jumper, with many seasons in the sport across many continents. The previous lines Jay had flown this season were extreme and all executed well. Jay was in a good head space and told us the previous night “Man, I really do love my life right now”.
Conclusion: The unfortunate loss of our mate Jay is deeply felt by the BASE jumping community. He was a well-liked and respected individual within the sport, and his passing represents a significant loss. Jay was a colourful character, the life of the party who made everyone around him laugh. If you were around Jay while he was in the mountains you knew you would be having a good time. Jay had a passion for Wingsuit BASE and loved every minute of it.
You were a legend Jay and you won’t be forgotten. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of careful terrain assessment and precision during Wingsuit BASE jumps, even for experienced jumpers. If you’re flying a new line, fly it high the first time. Stay alive. Love you Jay, WB & PK

First jump in this location for both. Last year we didn’t make it due to the weather. So, this season was one of our goals. We studied the hike and the jump properly and chose a dry weather day to do it. We took the first bus up to bussalp, go with some friends to bussalp exit to see them jumping and then keep going up. Didn’t take too long to get there, waited for 20 min resting and started gearing up. Some gusts of head wind were coming but followed by calm. Shade in the wall but few meters after sunny. He decided to jump first, good push and started flying soon but seemed like sinking a bit after the 4th second. Turned left and I saw him flying to the right side of the ledge. Then he passed to the other side of the mountain so I couldn’t see him anymore. According to what the police say after seeing the footage, he started flying too low from the first part of the flight. The second section was a flatter terrain where you cannot see it from the first section. He went too low in that part realising that wasn’t going to be able to pass the second flatter section, he tried an emergency pull but not in time. Probably the head wind, high temperature and shade in the wall make us sink more than usual even with a good exit. At least felt a bit of not much power from the 4th to 9th second. Also, a bit turbulent flight due to the stronger wind at the mid-flight. Bruno was a very experienced jumper, Skydive instructor and many years of Wingsuit base and Wingsuit test pilot. Healthy and sporty guy. Taking seriously everything. He passed away doing what he loved all his life. He is going to be missed. Big hug for his friends and family"

I was gonna have some jumps from more conservative exits before venturing to exit 8, to dial everything in. So we did 3 jumps from various exits together before going to exit 8. On the day of the accident we jumped exit 4.5 in the morning and he seemed really on his game. He was gonna take it all the way along the wall and land on the (leg breaking LZ) don’t remember it’s exact name! But something like that. I turned half way to the Primary LZ. It was an awesome jump. We had decided before this jump that we would go to exit 8 afterwards.
We jumped on the chopper around 1pm. When we landed he asked me if I was nervous, I told him that I didn’t actually feel nervous but more tense. He said that he actually felt nervous and that he could feel it now! But I was all smiles, laughs and love. There were 6 of us. 4 x Wingsuit’ and then Kivi and me In our OnsiePower 19. Which we actually had our first jump in together at Brento back in March 2019. We talked about that when we arrived to exit 8. It felt exactly like that. A little tense of the whole situation.
It was my first time at exit 8 so I was very “excited” to see what it looked like and how it felt inside my mind and body. I felt that it was absolutely durable so I felt good and ready.
Kivi had jumped exit 8 a few times before, in both 2 piece and Onesie. So he told where and how to fly the lines, where to go and where not to go. He told me to not get too close to the right side of the cliff when you leave/exit the gully.
The weather conditions were good. No wind at the exit and maximum 1-2 Knots from the east when getting out of the gully.
We knew that we were probably not gonna make it to the primary LZ so the plan was to land on the leg breaking LZ which is along the rocky beach way before the primary LZ for most jumps from Kjerag wall.
We geared up and everything seemed just perfect. We all hugged and everybody had their game face on. So we exited Kivi first me right behind him and then the Wingsuiters. After a few seconds the wingsuiters had flown straight over us and left the valley.
So for some reason he flew all the way to the left side of the gully, like along the left side, I stayed more or less in the middle of the gully. We had good speed and good height, so everything was going as planned. When we got to the end of the gully Kivi made a slight turn to the right, direction LZ. I’m a little higher than him and a little behind on his right side. So he crossed from left to right in front of me. Here he suddenly loses all performance in his suit. He loses all forward speed and starts to fall vertically. He suddenly puts his arms in front of him. I do not know if it was because he had actually tried to pull and was waiting for the pilot chute to come out! But nothing happend and he is getting close to the tree line at the end of the gully fast. Then it’s like he is trying to recover, maybe an unstable position, he makes a couple of swim strokes (winding up the windows in a car)  and then pulls his pilot chute. But very very sadly to late and he goes through the trees/cliff in line stretch. Before he comes to rest the parachute is actually more or less inflated.
As soon as I landed we called 113 and not to long after the rescue was in the area.
I’ve known Kivi since 2013. He inspired me right away, both his passion for jumping but also his attitude. He became a very good friend. I’m so so sorry for everyone who knew Kivi and especially his family and also all those who will not get to meet and get inspired by this beautiful soul.

The line was to go right around everything, follow the ridge and go for the landing in the forest road.
Exit was good and at 6 s Thomas goes for an aggressive right turn and then impact at 7-8 s on the end of a pillar.
After many discussions on the video , we think that it is a bad trajectory analyse.
What seems to happens is :
As he is high, he took a quick look on the right and thought ok I can turn now as I am high enough.
And then he probably didn't look anymore to this close point, and look very far to the direction we are going.
The turn was bit too aggressive and made him lose more altitude than what he predicted.
The moment he touches the rock, there is no sign of any change like mini flare or something, he is still in his turn, as if he doesn't even see what is below him (probably as he was looking far on the line."

We exchanged names and wished each other a good jump. The 3 of us had successful jumps.
After 10-15 min in the BASE LZ, I looked up at the exit and thought I could see the solo jumper on the platform. I started to walk from the LZ on the road to the parking lot. I missed the initial exit, but shortly after could see a red Wingsuit in an unstable and uncontrolled freefall, spinning.
About 3/4 below exit it appeared he regained control but was close and flying parallel to the wall. At that moment a tree obscured my view as we were slowly walking. I had expected to see a canopy right after passing the tree, but did not. Then heard a very loud crack, similar to a loud gunshot.
I tried to get a better view of the talus to see if there was any sign of the jumper. A call was made to air glacier and rega. Shortly after an air glacier helicopter made multiple passes in the area and then landed next to the PG landing zone. We spoke with the local police and air glaciers about what we saw and heard, others had also heard the same sound.
They went up to search on foot and eventually after about an hour, did find the jumper deceased in the area we had suspected below exit."

After leaving the canyon, he performs a corkscrew, which appears to cause him to lose speed.
He continues flying to the right, down to the Stolle forest, following the Hinderlaui trench low above the trees.
After a flyby over trees at approximately 744 m.a.s.l. (200 m above landing), he continues flying along the terrain, directly above the Chriesistei path. Just above landing at about 80 m (maybe even lower), he initiates a flare with little or no gain in altitude (deceleration instead of flaring).
First pull attempt: He reaches back with only his right hand (asymmetric pull) and does not find the handle.
Second pull attempt: Due to his asymmetrical position, he rolls slightly to his right and fabric from his arm wing appears to get in the way. He grabs more fabric than handle and performs a pull movement but does not throw the pilot chute.
Third pull attempt: Once he reaches back with his left hand as well (symmetrical pull), his right hand gets to the handle and he has a successful pull. PC extracts the canopy from the container but he impacts in a horizontal body position before line stretch (primary stow still in place). Dom appears to remain calm and focused until end.
Interpretation and conclusion:
Dominik enjoyed every single flight until the very end and often separated late from the terrain. The altitude that he gained from the flare was often needed to get a good pull altitude. On this flight he did not have a Flysight (GPS) with him.
A combination of factors contributed to the accident:
Loss of speed following his corkscrew after leaving the canyon
Late and only marginal separation from terrain
Flare was ineffective resulting in the deployment process happening at lower-than-expected altitude
First pull attempt: Asymmetric pull results in tilt to right, further loss of altitude.
Second pull attempt: He couldn’t get to the pilot chute because of fluttering fabric on his right arm wing (low airspeed and depressurizing wingsuit).
Individually, each of these points would probably not have been a problem. In total, they were fatal.
Recommendations:
Give yourself margin for the unexpected.
Don’t depend on a good flare to get reasonable pull altitude.
A flare can work 100 times and it can fail on the 101st time.

After the early morning Brento load we went with 2 other jumpers to the Paganella cave exit. We stopped at the refuge on top for coffee on route, he was in good spirits, excited to jump a new exit. We arrived at the gear up area and there was no visibility due to cloud. Winds were light at the exit and landing area. We got dressed slowly and descended to the exit, after a short wait the clouds opened, and the 1st jumper went. Mark had asked to watch someone else fly first. Once the first jumper had landed Mark moved into position. His initial exit push looked normal but shortly afterwards he turned slightly to the left, he turned back to the right and ended up over correcting and then turning back to the left and then to the right once more. During these corrections he was very ""flat"" and the suit was most likely stalling as he had almost no forward movement. After around 7 seconds the suit finally made some forward movement but he was already very low and impacted the terrain with nothing out 10 seconds after exit. We can only speculate as to Mark's thought process, there was sufficient time for an emergency pull but perhaps he still felt he could out fly the terrain. My condolences to Mark's family and friends. He was well liked within the community, easily spotted on the exit with his famous red mohawk helmet."

Alex discussed flying around the back of a rock spire, which requieres a good start and good glide to reach. Zero wind at the exit, which faces north-west so it is protected.Normal push, good start. He appeared to be flying very slowly. It's possible that his performance was affected by the south wind. At any time he could abort by flying to the right. He impacted into the trees before reaching the spire. There was no attempt to pull, the container was closed. It seems he died instantly.
What we can learn, the lesson we already know, is that we need to fly with speed and be ready to change the plan. Even very experienced jumpers can sometimes make the mistake of flying without speed.
Alex was an inspiring person to be around, always ready to laugh, generous and big hearted. He will be sorely missed by the Spanish jumping community and others who's heart he has touched."

Luis Manzaneda Medianero,SPAIN,,2023-03-21,,,,,,Spain,BASE Fatality,Earth,Unknown,"Slick, Slick by Everyday Clothing worn",Unknown,Unknown,"Slider Down-Off, BOC, BOC",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,"Description:
Hello, we tried to figure out as many details as possible, for us and for his family but everything is assumptions, the real truth we will never know, but we really think this is the closest to what could have happened to Luis.
First of all, we thought Luis had a 180 with a cliff strike to the ground. While checking the rig we realized toggles were still in break mode, never released. And we could see there was one toggle in shallow mode and another one in deep mode, so one more reason to contribute and emphasize a possible offheading. It was also his first jump after 3 years of not jumping, so other possibilities like unstable position, etc were also in our minds.
We could then speak to the two people that witnessed the accident, and it is when we realized by what they explained that Luis never jumped from the real exit. He was 20 meters on the right (facing the cliff). Luis sent us a picture while he was gearing up, and it confirms that he jumped from a place where no exit was possible. Our conclusion is that Luis in fact never jumped but fell while checking this new exit point. From the top you don’t see the big ledge, but if you climb down a couple of meters of unstable terrain, then you realize there is a big ledge 30 meters down below, very difficult to jump over even with a strong push. We believe he went down to check and for an unknown reason he fell and so as a last resort he tried to push and jump while pitching the PC asap. He impacted in the ledge while the parachute was not yet fully deployed.
We know how important it is to triple check your pack job, and to take all security measures as much as possible when opening a new exit even if you feel comfortable walking on the edge of a cliff. Once more this proves that all measures are not enough and that we all make mistakes.
Although link says paraglider this was a base jumping death."

The rescue team arrived and tried CPR but couldn’t help him. JP was a great person, and friend, very motivated and driven. A super sporty person, professional kitesurfer and good skydiver. He will be deeply missed by his friends and family for his strong energy and for the great friend he was.
Updated 10th March - Written by the jumper with him
Ski-base was one of JP's dream, as it was for me, so when I went to inspect the cliff in my local resort that I knew had already being jumped, he was already committed to do it as well. My measurements showed that it's a cliff that doesn't allow for mistakes: it's not a big one and even though the straight line is slightly overhung, at the sides you have some edges that make an off heading quite a problem.
The take off and in run are though really nice, and that helped our confidence.
By the time he got to the resort with a friend, for what should have been a week of fun, the forecast had changed and it looked like we'd had available 3-4 days of good weather.
We spent the first day skiing, hitting jumps in the park and on the slopes, it was the first time I saw him skiing and I felt reassured, as he was a good skier, solid on his skis and well balanced in the air.
We ended the day having a look at the cliff and inspecting the landing area.
Probably with a bit of pressure from the weather forecast he told me he wanted to go for it the following day, and without much hesitation I agreed, we had an easy dinner and set a meeting point for the following day at lift's opening.
On our way to the exit we went for few more jumps off some nice rollers, again no problems or hesitations. At the top of the last lift we parted ways with our friend as he wasn't going to jump and will watch us from a slope right in front of the exit.
As we got to the exit I found out the snow has melted more than expected since my last jump and told him that the starting point now would be a few meters below what I did in my previous 2 jumps, he asked me if I thought it was still ok and I replied that it shouldn't be too much of a difference.
We went to the edge and I showed him the right direction, he expressed a little bit of a concern about the slight turn that has to be done in order to go around a rock and get the right direction, I told him not to worry about that, has it was far into his ability, not to overthinking it and to focus instead on the exit position.
We geared up and he decided to go first, handheld. He had the Go pro on his helmet and I suggested to remove it and so he did. From the already lower start position, instead of pointing his skis to the little turn and the fall line, he slowly side slipped forward losing some meters and what in my opinion, might have been some speed that could have helped him. He then turned his skis to the exit.
In the first moments in the air, instead of keeping the tucked-race position we agreed was better, he extended his leg and went into a more belly to earth position.
What follows is a supposition of what might have happen by looking at the video and what we saw inspecting his container and risers (the canopy hasn't been recovered).
From the video took by our friend positioned in front of the exit, we can see that between the pilot chute throw and the opening, his body turn slightly to the left and this, once his canopy opens with a 90 to the right, probably resulted also thanks to the added inertia of the weight of boots and skis, to violent rotation of his body back to the right which might have caused the last mistake: he released only his left toggle and not the right one, this might have been the reason why his canopy does another 90 degrees turn to the right and brings him to impact.
From the exit I've only heard the opening and not the expected scream of joy, I look at our friend standing on the slope and I see him moving frantically, I realize how stupid I have been to not exchange telephone numbers with him. I get to the edge but can't see anything included our friend that was supposed to move to the landing after the first jump, eventually I calmed myself down, went back up, and did my jump. Under canopy I tried to see if I could spot anything but with no success, at that point I believed it was just a trip that I got myself into. But once I landed alone I got informed that patrollers have been called and a microlight started to fly above the area, with no success in spotting him for over 30 minutes but eventually found him, his white and green canopy might have not helped.
The rescue Heli with the needed hoist was busy in another rescue and got to JP an hour later after the call, reanimation has been tried but it was soon after declared dead.
Speaking with the first doctor from the Heli, said he thought JP probably died at impact."

Kali popped her pin while getting her gear out. She asked another jumper on the load for a pull-up cord while they were gearing up. She then threw it back at him, said thanks, and started putting her gear on.
The other jumper had to connect his suit to his rig and took longer.
Kali waited for him and they went to the exit together. She jumped first and he watched her jump. She had a good exit, good flight, she flared, pulled and he noticed her pilot chute in tow. She started losing altitude fast and reached back before getting unstable and impacting the trees.
This type of pin lock malfunction cannot be cleared by pulling on the bridle, and the pin cannot be released by pulling on the bridle below it. To fix the mal, you must open the pin flap and pull the bridle out from between the two pins – this is not really possible in a wingsuit in flight.
She was a smart jumper and we can only assume she didn’t know about this malfunction.
All jumpers should know that you should never replace a popped pin unless you fully check your bridle routing all the way from PC to canopy attachment points.
The video shows very clearly how the pin and bridle was mis-rigged and how this leads to a total mal.."

3 of us on exit, first jumper jumps and throws a gainer and opens with no issues and then lands on the big field underneath.
Marvin decides he is feeling good and wants to exit, he threw a gainer, but this was too quick and over rotated so he decided to throw in another and then threw the pilot chute but has came out and wrapped in a bow style around his leg and then as he further rotates the bridle starts to wrap around his body. The other jumpers rush to Marvin but there is nothing anyone can do Marvin was killed on impact.
The other two jumpers rushed to Marvin and seen that he had been killed on impact and there was nothing they could do. They noticed that Marvin had managed to free the bridle but wasn't quick enough, the jumpers could see that the bridle had now been released and that one pin has popped on impact but no canopy out.

As long ago as in June 2022 Anatoly made all the necessary measurements and prepared a plan. He waited for a day with the perfect weather conditions because of the technically difficult exit.
 
The day October, 29th 2022 had those conditions. That day, coming to the peak, Anantoly and Mario found a new spot, which was 20 meters higher than the original one, however located to the right of the flight axis and the deepest part of the couloir. Anantoly measured the place again with two lasers, and the guys made a decision to use the new exit point, which seemed more comfortable.
 
Mario was absolutely sure, that the landscape measurements of this exit were similar to Ferrari, which suggests with high probability that Anatoly was of the same opinion.
 
The initial part of the landscape, bordering on the exit, is located in a closed couloir; in addition, at that time of the day it was in the shade, which made it really difficult to see the details of the landscape. In fact it turned out to be similar to the exit La Stella, where, as soon as two seconds after the push, the landscape aggressively falls upon you on the right. However, unlike La Stella exit, in this case the space for a manoeuvre on the left was limited.
 
The deepest part of the couloir was located on the left, however the exit sector in this direction was limited by the wall. Besides that, about 100 m further the flight line was supposed to go on the right because of the specifics of the landscape, which defined the exit vector.
 
Everything happened in 6 seconds. After the push, as soon as the landscape began to move, all the hidden details became visible, including the ledge imperceptible from the exit point, which turned out to be right on the trajectory of the flight. Anatoly realised that the prepared jump plan did not correspond to the reality, but there was too little time to change it. He made an input to the left to slide in direction of the saving depth. He hadn’t reached the terminal speed yet, that’s why the input did not have the immediate result, and Anatoly reinforced it. However, a few seconds later, when the speed was already sufficient, this movement turned out to be excessive, which led to an uncontrollable deviation of the flight trajectory to the left and impact with the rock.
 
The impact caused the deployment of the canopy, which caught hold of the rock about 20 meters lower the impact point.
 
The rescue team verified immediate death due to fatal injuries."

It was a beautiful morning, and the mountains and trees were covered in snow. We watched them marry on the bottom of the Eiger, under the mushroom. The ceremony was beautiful, we caught up with a lot of friends we haven’t seen in ages. Jonno and I hadn’t seen each other in a week, so we sneaked out of there super early without saying goodbye (sorry guys) and took the train back home. We got out off the train at Kleine Scheidegg around 4. There was a half an hour layover, and we walked out a bit and got into a huge snowball fight. Not far from us was an Asian couple taking Instagram, perfect loving snow shots. They looked at us in shock and I just said, ‘well there’s two types of relationships.’ Where after we continued attacking each other with snowballs. We were home in Lauterbrunnen at 5pm, had a chilled night, made some chicken burgers, drank some healthy fruit juice, and watched Pirates of the Caribbean in a massive beanbag, laughing about being old.
The following morning, we got up around 8, had some coffee and homemade banana bread and tried to visit Sandi to cuddle the baby cows. They said Nadja really wanted to see Jonno, and she’d be back a bit later, so they asked us to come back in the afternoon.
We decided that we’d go for a jump first. Jonno wanted to do a 2-way. I suggested he take his wingsuit, but he wanted to go slick, so I asked him to at least wear some drag. He pulled the Pikachu onesie out of the cupboard, and I just laughed. We took the 10.38 gondola up, followed by the train to Winteregg. We stopped there had some coffee on the terrace and watched the view. He took some photos for an Asian couple and went full focus on that. Those that know him will laugh at this, because you can just picture him trying to get the perfect framing and instructing them on how to pose and where to stand. 
We slowly walked down to Nose 3, he joked about doing a gainer and I said that was a stupid idea as he only ever jumps his wingsuit. When we got there the conditions were perfect. We both started gearing up and I routed the Pikachu tails through the left side lateral of his rig, because I was afraid it might be a snag hazard. We gave each other gear checks, kissed, and walked down. We got to the exit, called Air Glacier, and got clearance to jump. Jonno did the countdown, I did a flat and stable exit while looking under my right shoulder, I could see him do a gainer, go unstable and tumble. From the footage and what I’ve seen, we gathered the following:
 
12.39pm
0 sec: exit + gainer
2 sec: starts too over-rotate
4 sec: unstable drops right side of body
6 sec: turned 90 degrees to the right and pitches
7 sec: Jonno is facing away from the wall
8 sec: Canopy fully inflated, 180 degrees facing the wall.
9 sec: He grabs the rear right and front left risers. Then drops the rear right riser and starts to pull down on the front left riser.
10 sec: Both hands on front left riser. Pulling hand over hand, up the lines.
11 sec: First impact.
13 sec: Canopy collapses. Still holding front left lines.
14 sec: Second Impact. He lets go of the front left lines and they wrap around the Insta 360 unicorn extension. The canopy is still facing the wall. The front risers have (swoop/dive/Louie) loops. The left riser loop snags on the lower unicorn mount bolt (6cm long), at the helmet mount.
15-18sec: He slides down the wall.
19 sec: He tries to unhook the riser loop.
23 sec: Third impact. Lines twisting up.
27 sec: He pops the right brake.
28 sec: Fourth impact.
32 sec: He’s still trying to clear the malfunction. Front left riser loop is still snagged on the lower bolt.
33 sec: The camera mount snaps at the helmet but is wrapped in his lines and slider. The canopy turns to the left.
34 sec: He tries to control the left turn.
36 sec: Fifth impact. He seems to lose consciousness and the camera falls away.
We spoke with a few jumpers who saw the incident from the ground. They said that he then fell to a ledge, where he was hanging for about 5 minutes. The canopy released from the wall, and he fell to the top of the talus.
Jonno was a legend and a beautiful human. He will be dearly missed by all who had the privilege to meet him."

On the day he gave no different signs of being more or less stressed and we arranged to fly the forest line. He pushed 1 sec after me which a 3rd jumper confirmed later. He was always over 50m behind me until we disappeared from the 3rd jumper's perspective still on exit.
I flew voluntary lower and I adapted to his angle of flying as I do often and thinking he'll stay above me, with what was briefed before jumping. I answered to all his questions and waited for his ok to make a countdown.
I realized very quickly I'm alone under a canopy and tried to call him with no answer so I called the Rega and they did an unbelievably good job on the rescue and retrieval. He was found with an opened canopy but closed eyes, unfortunately too late. I have many suggestions and assumptions but until we find his camera, I can't really know what has happened.
Most probable to me, he realized too late of not passing a hill, tried to escape left, trapped into a cuve, pulled and impacted.
It was not his first scex rouge and he knew where to escape but made a mistake somewhere in his present decisions. After several discussions with other close friends of Adrien they all said he loved to fly close to the ground and fly close to terrain, even with his low level of experience and was told on numerous occasions to slow down by them and myself included

We started from the bottom of the valley around 05:30 a.m., and we stopped for a coffee at the refuge around 07:00 a.m. When we got to the exit, after about 1800m of elevation gain, we decided to wait for good conditions. We got ready and loaded some light mountaineering equipment that we were carrying and we jumped around 10:00. The weather conditions were zero wind but when we started to fly on the glacier the Katabatic wind was noticeable. We flew a technical line where I filmed Jonny. The flight had several sharp turns, after one of these turns came a flatter part just at the end of the glacier, in an area with a river and I saw how Jonny hit the ground. I had to continue flying in order to disconnect from the ground and to be able to open. I did not see him again and called the emergency services.
I suppose that the main reason for the accident is flying so close to the ground, but regarding the technical part, I would say that it was not the first time we had flown the glacier, and that is perhaps why we flew closer than other times; that many tight consecutive turns make you lose speed; and that the glacial Katabatic wind sinks you towards the ground, especially I noticed it at the end of the glacier, in the area where the accident occurred.
From other friends:
Jonny was an accomplished alpinist and climber, and loved combining climbing with jumping. He was incredibly motivated and trained hard both in climbing and jumping for his alpine projects. He had excellent ability in flying. However he also had a tendency to go all out and fly right at the limit.
Please note he was born in Israel but his closest friends had explained he had obtained Spanish citizenship and would like him written as Spanish not Israeli.
Jon was a big hearted man who brought so much joy and happiness to everyone around him. He lived at full speed. He was much loved by many and will be sorely missed by his family and friends."

I met Chris on Sunday at the Eiger the first time this season, but we were texting for the last couple of days, trying to sort things out for the upcoming missions. Chris and I have jumped a handful of times before and our first two ways were back in 2019.
On Monday 18th it was time for the Dream lines jump.. I was super stoked about jumping that Exit with him and so was Chris, He was super happy to share it with me.
He opened this Exit in 2021 and told me all the background stories on the hike, what a mission it was finding the exit and that he already did 15 or 16 flights since
then, knowing the terrain by heart and having a detailed plan of his next line.
We watched his last flight videos 10+ times, analysing and studying the line, he was going to take. Chris watched some sections over and over again moved
his shoulders and body, imagining the turns and flightpath, he was getting really into it.
He was very detailed when briefing the whole flight until the end part where he was not clear about his intentions.
He said the terrain flight would be more or less over after the houses and that there is clear airspace to our left.
We were stoked on exit, we didn't rush and everything felt good. It is a north facing exit
so it is in the shadow and there was not a lot of lift also almost no wind. The flightpath is on the southside of the mountain, fully exposed to the sun
and it was already late. Being my first jump there, I knew I would fly higher above the terrain.
We exited at 1pm and turned left to fly around the ridge and into the terrain. When we crossed the ridge we hit a wall of lift, it felt bumpy and I saw Chris struggling a bit.
We pitched down, entered the first gulley and picked up speed and got into efficient flight. I was high above Chris when we flew far left around a group of trees and then lined
up to head right again towards the houses.
We were coming from the left, heading to the right, traversing across the terrain towards the houses. We were flying fast but in turbulent air and probably a bit slower than expected.
After flying over the houses the way out of the terrain goes left but Chris did a slight turn to the right instead into what looked like flat terrain from my perspective. It looked like he was boxed in below tree level with no way to turn left to fly out.
As I cleared to the left, I could see him tilting up the suit, initiating a massive flare, using up all his speed to clear the terrain and flare over the trees at the end.
He gave everything. He disappeared low behind the trees and I couldn´t see the first impact. The next moment I could see him reappearing with a lot of momentum,
tumbling down the cliff face without any conscious movement and finally coming to a rest after heavy impact about 50-60m lower at the bottom of the cliff. No canopy out.
He had no chance. I flew away from the scene, out to the middle of the valley, pulled, landed and called REGA. His death was confirmed by the medic.
Chris was flying his dream line, while living his dream, giving everything until the end. It was not enough.
Everybody who knew Chris, knows, what a great human being he was, what a big heart and spirit he embodied.
Chris was driven by his dreams, still humble and open to listen and learn but also self conscious and knowing about his capabilities.
Always open and sharing his knowledge with the community. He was 100% aware of what he was doing, what the consequences are. He was ready and willing to accept.
Undoubtedly he will be remembered as one of the best if not the best of his time, a free bird, chasing his dream of flying the dream lines.
He once said his passion for flying, the art he put into his flights is his way of expressing himself.
Art is controversial sometimes, it is confronting us with uncomfortable questions and the artist left without clear answers.
All I can say is, that we both were extremely happy and free at the exit, hugging each other and sharing a great time
together, aware and conscious, ready to take whatever may come.
Fly free brother. It was an honour to know you and to share a piece of life together. You will be missed but you will not be forgotten. Love you heaps broey!
Yeeeeeeeewwwh!"

He had jumped it once before – the day prior – and he had a very head low exit on that jump. He was current in the onesie and had been jumping it comfortably at other exits in the valley.
After that first jump at High Ultimate, he commented that he felt he had enough separation from the lower ledge that if he had needed to do an emergency front flip, he could do it and still clear the ledge. On his second and fatal jump at the exit, video from Low Ultimate shows that the jumper went very head low and then onto his back – completing the first half of a front flip – before falling out of view. The eye-witness jumper at low ultimate heard an impact and then saw a canopy flying without inputs.
Jumpers near the LZ saw a canopy in line twists landing south of the LZ and ran over to the jumper after he bounced on landing. It was immediately apparent that the jumper was deceased based on the state of his head and body. The jumper’s helmet was gone, he was not wearing a camera.
His bottom closing loop was missing and his top closing loop was broken, which, along with eye witness account from low ultimate and the state of the jumper’s body make it clear that the jumper impacted the ledge in freefall and his parachute deployed when the force of the impact opened his container. He was pronounced dead by a doctor at the scene."

Update 9th December 2024
Written by a close personal friend
There were no witnesses to Johnny 's incident and from what I know there was no video, or at least none was found.
It was noted by the rescue team that the injuries reported showed a high-speed impact.
Considering the point where the body was found, we can assume that he made a proximity flight line that was too close to the limit, and impacted a ledge, as he hasn't been able to fly past it.
As far as I remember Jonny was flying a Sausage but He wasn't very good at flying even if he was improving, the problem is that sometimes his suit would become highly unstable with significant rolling and pitching movements.
In a proximity line with a single piece unfortunately there is no margin, the flight must be clean, if you lose control, even a little, the lateral movements and the resulting loss of altitude, become a key factor that if not calculated can lead to disastrous results.
Unfortunately this is the most we can know based on the data collected.
What is certain is that Jonny was pushing a lot in the last period before the accident, even though in my opinion he had not yet developed the right skills, and honestly it had been pointed out to him on more than one occasion.
Things then went in the worst possible way, and as always in this activity everyone makes his own choices.
I want to add that Jhonny was a very nice guy, with thirst for adventure and genuinely stoked on life. He will be missed!"

We made plans the evening before to head up to ""Happy Birthday"" on the morning of the 3rd.
Dylan had jumped Happy Birthday in previous years, but had not jumped there in a while. When we got to the exit he lasered the exit with the intention of giving the numbers to another jumper, and remarked that the exit was bigger than he had thought it was. The wind was calm on exit.
Dylan was second to exit on a load of five jumpers. Dylan had a stable exit. I watched his flight, and from the exit, his flight appeared to be slower. Dylan flew far right over the terrain, and I lost sight of him. I heard a loud noise which I initially thought was a canopy, but I couldn’t spot him under canopy. In my opinion, a line further to the right would be possible on a later jump when there are thermals present, but would be difficult in the early morning when there are no thermals.
We’re currently waiting on fly sight data and the video which would provide more insight into what happened.
Dylan was a kind and gentle soul who had experienced some trauma over recent years with the loss of a close friend and a serious tandem/skydiving related neck injury. He was determined to make this year a positive year and was always full of bright, bubbly energy. He will be missed very much by many people."

Kalen and another jumper had shuttled cars to the main landing area very early in the morning to hopefully get two in for the day (they had done three the day prior). Kalen had fallen asleep very early the prior day and was well rested despite the early start.
Upon reaching the summit of Chaserugg, winds were ~10kts over the back (up from the North - ie, where the cable car goes) and the Walenstadt valley was beginning to show very early signs of thermals (light wispy clouds developing and rising up the faces). Kalen and the other jumper walked to exit at a ""casual"" pace, agreed that the two jump plan was probably no longer in play, and to get to exit to assess if one was going to happen.
Upon reaching exit, conditions were near perfect. No wind up and over the shoulder behind Sputnik, with light thermic updrafts. Thrown grass gently fell down the face. Grass on exit was lightly blowing upward. The first jumper landed without incident, and waited for Kalen, who never arrived. A hiker had heard the impact, and immediately called mountain rescue. After 30mins, the police arrived in the landing area, the first jumper pointed out Kalen's rental car, and the police began opening it to find identification.
Kalen was the second jumper of a two-jumper load. He came to rest near the bottom of the pillar separating the bowl beneath Sputnik from the adjacent bowl, before the grass shelf entrance to the crack. He did not survive impact. I was the next load to exit, and was the first to exit. I saw what looked like a canopy mid-line, with a car and two people, then began to hear a helicopter coming upvalley. I watched the entirety of the recovery.
As Kalen was not wearing a gopro or flysight, and there were no eyewitnesses, the following is not definitive but based upon the inspection of his gear, the descriptions of his injuries from the police, and the location where he came to rest. It is strongly believed that he impacted a tree while inflight along the ridge to jumper's left of Sputnik, prior to making a left turn to overfly the grass toward the tree gates. Flight plans prior to the jump had not been discussed with the other jumper.
On a personal note - I met Kelan years ago at Perris, and I've been jumping with him for the last week as the Lauterbrunnen spring weather has allowed. I found Kelan to be a shy, reserved guy, but after warming up a bit to be just incredibly brilliant, intellectually curious, and deeply empathetic. We had some great conversations on a lot of muddy hikes, and I very much enjoyed the time together. As we both work in tech, the conversations oft drifted into some of the nerdier aspects of flying wingsuits, with significant focus on starts, start arcs, and how to assess an exit. He said he had been spending a lot of time working on his, which I watched several times over multiple days, and which I would describe as nearly perfect. His flights were calculated and technically proficient from exit to landing.
I'm very much going to miss not getting to share more of those hikes with him."

This was the 3rd jump of the day in the gorge. The first 2 were slider up from La Conque and Bourni. I decided to go for a chilled 3rd jump to finish the day slider down from Bourni for a long canopy ride (1300ft rock drop) out of our group of 6 three decided not to jump as they were tired. Andy had skipped jumps previously because of fatigue but decided to come along on this one. He wanted to jump first with us following one by one a couple of seconds after we hear the opening and conditions were good. He jumped with a good running exit and stayed in view for around 5 seconds still holding the pc, there was no wrap and he was completely stable. I have no idea why he held the pc that long and just before the exit we talked about keeping the delays around 1.5 seconds so we could meet up under canopy but i guess it was around 6 second delay in the end. I heard the canopy open hard and it seems he was unconscious or dazed under canopy with no attempt at an input under canopy and with a slow turn into the wall. We jumped and saw the canopy hung up on the wall but too far up for us to get too. I sent an sos from a garmin inreach and called for a rescue. He had a second fall whilst waiting for the heli. He was alive when they got him from the wall and died later that evening in the hospital. It's been a difficult one to take as he was always happy to take a step back and jump within his limits, never intending to become a name in base he just wanted to have fun with his friends. I find it hard to believe that he could have made the mistake of thinking he was slider up as he had a 46 pc in his hand. He was also complaining about the hard opening on the jump previous that was slider up. The last few days have been spent organising the repatriation of his body, luckily he had found insurance that seems to cover it all. A really fun good person who fell in love with base jumping instantly I'm really sad for his family luckily he had no children but it doesn't stop his partners heart break.

Hugues goes first and turns immediately to the left to pass the first gate and fly on the left side of the first ridge. He flies deeper than usual but with more speed, he flattens out to pass a first obstacle lower than usual, goes flatter again to increase his glide but realizes that he is a little too low to pass the second ridge (which is facing him and oriented 90 degrees from the one he's going along).
He decides to turn right to pass on a lower point between the 2 ridges but his turn is not very sharp and the wing stalls slightly on the right, which makes him lose too much height, he flies about 2s to 3s more and impacts in flight about 2m below the top of the ridge. Hugues had a passion for beautiful flying lines and was always chasing novelty: he rarely jumped the same exit or flew the same line several times. He was a really talented flyer but his lines were committed, which he was totally aware of. This accident reminds us that no matter your experience level you should always have an out and avoid turning on the inside of an object.
Hugues was a wonderful adventure companion who travelled a lot and was really connected to nature: always barefoot and often ass naked. He was a kind and good man, always ready to help others to progress with a lot of joy and happiness: having Hugues around was a guarantee of good laughs and epic jumps! He had a really strong mind and good values: despite his accomplishments in competition he always stayed really simple, willing to connect with others and will share the passion with you no matter if you were a rock star or a total beginner.
He was this very strong and very handsome buddy who knew how to do everything and whom you could love more than yourself.
His close ones miss him a lot and so do the people they didn't know... Thank you for having been you, my buddy... we love you!

The day before he did 3 jumps of HU and one of High Nose and was happy with his results. On this jump, he was first on a two-way with a wingsuiter. He did a one-step exit as usual, had an average push, slightly unstable. He brought his arms back very soon, legs slightly bent which caused an over rotation/scorpion. Thomas corrected his angle quickly to a fully extended but flat tracking position. The suit started to pressurize but no forward movement and he clipped the very last part of the ledge with his lower legs. Only 20cm were missing to clear it into clean airspace. This caused a big momentum and sent him into a violent unstable rotation. He went back into tracking position but was probably disoriented or in shock and impacted the wall with nothing out. Canopy came out on impact. Coroner said Thomas was dead immediately.
What's to take away from this incident:
1) If Thomas had done a running exit instead of a slower one-step exit, he might have had enough forward momentum to clear the talus even with his scorpion exit.
2) Leaving Hands in front for longer time when in Scorpion position, would probably help him to not rotate to the side and give him much faster transition into the track position, which would let him to out track the ledge.
The correction into a flat angle was the cause for clipping the talus. Staying in head down until passing the talus might have saved him from clipping his feet.
3) Between clipping feet and impact 6 seconds passed. A panic pull might have saved his life. Thomas was a great guy, always friendly and smiling and he will be missed.
4) One more thing to add, it was the first day when you cant jump after 9am because of paragliders in the area, so people want to jump before 9am and at this time i think the conditions are the worst, you dont have any lift. Same day i did one jump around 7.50am and i had the feeling that after exit i was closer to the wall than usually.
Thomas had a safe and steady progression over the last years in the sport. He put in the work and never tried to cut any corners. He didnt push his limits and was very aware of what he was capable of and what he wasn't. Thomas was a great guy, always friendly and caring about everyone. He always had a huge smile on his face. His positive energy and attitude touched everyone who met him. It was impossible not to have a good time and not to laugh when he was around. He will be missed."

I don’t know his exact jump number stats but it was obvious he had been in the sport 25+ years and had a lot of BASE and skydiving experience.
It’s an exit I know well, it was Alberto’s first time. Most people wingsuit this exit, it’s also been done slider down many times. Alberto said he wasn’t very wingsuit current so he would go slider down.
Conditions at exit were perfect, zero wind. He did a gainer, I missed the exit on my video but from my memory he looked solid and symmetrical. I got him on video from his opening, he had a 180 degree off heading opening to the left, he hit the wall less than a second after opening, from this moment onwards I saw no evidence of any control input, so I’m guessing he was unconscious from the first hit, he had 30 seconds of canopy time, he hit the wall multiple times, I counted 9 impacts, the entire canopy ride he was facing the wall, he came to a stop on the wall just above the talus, about 300 meters below the exit. A helicopter rescue was called but aborted due to the difficult position he was in. It took a rescue team more than 4 hours to get to him on foot. He was dead when they reached him.
This exit has an impressive purpose built BASE ramp, I believe this puts people into a false sense of security, it’s a slightly positive wall, and the remoteness and steepness of the terrain made this rescue attempt very slow.

He asked me if I’ve been doing any wingsuiting in Moab. I told him yes, a bit. He said he was ready to make his first wingsuit BASE jump in Moab. He said he was current and ready. He had just returned from a WS (wingsuit) skydiving trip in AZ and a fall season spent jumping in Switzerland.
We talked about all the potential exit points available in the region. We selected Super Gorgeous, based on the vertical height of the cliff, the start arc, and the direction of the cliff face relative to the winter sun. We had planned to go out on Saturday initially, but the weather forecast didn’t look good. We discussed how important it is to have ideal conditions when making a jump of this type. The forecast for Thursday and Friday looked fantastic, so we changed our plans to jump Friday instead.
We touched base Thursday evening to confirm our plans, review the forecasted wind, sun, and high/low temperatures for the day. Everything lined up beautifully. Just below freezing in the early am, warm sunny winter day with light and variable winds till noon. There was a slight possibility of stronger winds on the forecast for later in the day, which did not occur. The winds were less than 5kts all day. Warm sun directly on the talus and cliff face all morning and throughout the day. We planned to allow three hours to hike and gear up. Jumping around 11:30 am - 12:00 pm
We met at Rocky Rapids at 8 AM and launched our SUPs by 8:30. We reviewed the exit point and potential flight lines from the bottom and began our hike. Midway through the hike, we noted an inversion layer and made a point to stay observant of the conditions. As we gained altitude and time passed, the inversion layer lifted, and the conditions changed to thermic.
We arrived at the exit point at 11:11 AM. Conditions appeared ideal: rising air with a light breeze from jumpers left to right. We once again reviewed all the relative elements involved in the jump. We established the lines we intended to fly and discussed the critical factors involved. At exactly noon, we hugged told each other, “I LOVE YOU!” and at 12:01, Jimmy pushed off.
His push was good, and the launch looked normal. One second into the start, Jimmy appeared to be slightly right shoulder low, potentially compensating for heading adjustment or possibly the crosswind element. As he got further into the start arc, it was apparent that he was working to maintain his heading down the center of the deepest part of the talus. His forward speed was not quite as high as I would expect during the first four to five seconds , and he was crabbing very slightly from right to left. Approximately six seconds into his fight, he impacted the talus. He did not clear the first ledge and was killed immediately upon impact. He came to rest a little further down the talus.
I immediately dispatched an SOS call from my InReach satellite communication device. Search & Rescue was on the scene as quickly as possible.
My best assessment of the factors contributing to this accident:
1. The jump itself has very little to no margin for error.
2. The suit Jimmy selected may not have given him every possible advantage in the start arc.
3. The slight left to right breeze had some effect on his ability to hold his chosen heading and affected his start arc and forward speed negatively.
4. A more downwind heading would have improved the forward speed in the initial portion of the start arc.
My last point is subjective and speaks towards anyone who may be considered jumps of this type or in this area. These jumps are very clearly, directly into terrain flight immediately after exit. I have not known Jimmy to be a “terrain flyer.” So we discussed this before exiting. I explained to him that in my previous flights from this exit point that the start arc transitions directly to terrain flight and that no matter how I might try, I could not outfly the terrain with any additional altitude beyond what was needed to fly at a minimum. He understood that as he stepped off. Unfortunately, he was not able to outfly the terrain.
My advice for anybody considering jumps of this type or in this area, ensure that your skill set includes an adequate margin for error and a familiarity with the severity and intensity of the flying style required and the circumstances to which we will be subjecting ourselves.
Even all that may not be enough.
Jimmy was one of my very best friends.
He was incredibly dear to me. I’m both utterly tortured and honored to have been with him on his final flight. I will speak towards the depth of his character and our loving friendship later.

UPDATE 21ST Jan 2022
There were 3 of us jumping (including Alex) and Alex’s wife Sian came with, like she has done on many of Alex’s previous jumps. We were originally planning to jump another object but decided on Skeffington (~200ft freestander) after a slight change to the winds (Alex’s suggestion). It was a planned night jump and weather was good.
We all arrived slightly later than planned and didn’t really discuss the jump that much other than that Alex was going to do a lower SL jump and the other 2 jumpers were going to go to the top (one SL and one handheld). We had a quick look at the LZ to the East of the object and put down 2 glow sticks.
We started to climb over the gate into the compound and note that Alex struggled to get over and ended up climbing over at a different point.
When climbing the ladder it is worth noting that the last jumper climbing made a comment about the ladder being muddy from the others’ boots.
Alex stopped at each platform and was using a laser to measure the height - so that he could determine where he would jump from. The other 2 jumpers continued to the top as planned. One of the jumpers recalls hearing Alex say ‘this one is 143ft, I’m going to go from here’. Alex was standing on a platform that was on the South side of the object, we could see this from the red light on his head torch.
The other two jumpers had kitted up and were in the process of tying off the SL for one of them. It was at this point that the object wobbled and one of them said ‘oh, there goes alex’. Immediately after, one of the other jumpers and his wife Sian, recall him shouting something (possibly ‘oh fuck!’). This was followed by a loud noise.
Alex’s wife Sian shouted for help, we responded asking if he was ok, to which she replied ‘no he’s unconscious, I’m calling an ambulance’.
We knew that we needed to get down quickly so we chose to jump. The HH jumper gave the other jumper a PCA to save time from finishing tying off the SL.
Alex’s body was laid to rest at the bottom of the fence after clearly impacting the roof of a small building and the fence (due to visible damage). he had made little forward movement suggesting the canopy had not inflated at all. He was fully kitted up with everything out, his canopy, bridle and PC were draped over the fence suggesting that he impacted prior to line stretch/canopy inflation. His wife Sian also recalls him having something out prior to impact.
Our initial thoughts were that Alex had died instantly from subterminal impact. We did the best we could and thank the emergency service for arriving promptly and their efforts to try and save him.
We have since returned to the object and note the following:
- There is no visible damage to the object where Alex was jumping from
- There was no anchor point or break cord left on the railings
- We did not find any anchor point or break cord on the ground
We are not sure if the police found any break cord or anchor point at the scene or on Alex’s person. If we find out that they did, we will update this.
We believe that Alex either slipped and fell from the object before (or during) tying off his SL, or, his SL failed. There are a number of factors that could have contributed to either of these scenarios.
If he slipped and fell:
- Did he climb over before tying his SL and was that his intention? Did he want his SL to be closer to his pins and would this have made it difficult to climb over once tied off?
- Were his muddy boots a factor?
- Did he throw his PC in attempt to save his life? Was it still stowed or was it in his hand?
- Did he have break cord or anchor point in his hand and dropped it as he fell?
- Did fatigue, strength or the darkness factor in?
If his SL failed:
- Did his anchor point fail?
- Did he tie off directly to the steel angle instead of using an anchor point?
- Did he use one or two pieces of break cord?
- Did he tie off to the centre point of his bridle or at the PC or both? (did static vs dynamic load play a part?). We have not had chance to inspect his gear yet but don’t recall seeing an overhand knot on the mid point of his bridle at the time. One of the jumpers who has seen Alex tie a SL before believes he usually followed the Apex method.
- Was the strength of the break cord compromised?
- Did the knot fail?
We think it is unlikely we will ever truly know what happened, but if any more information becomes available from the police/coroner we will share it and update this report.
Alex was a keen supporter of the East Anglian Air Ambulance, his wife Sian has set up a donation page for anybody that would like to make a donation.

Puerto Rico does not have many beginner friendly exit points. This cliff, known as “Jasmines Cliff” is one of the few cliff exits in PR and is a good jump with a static line or a good PCA, but if dropped, it is catastrophic.

A member of the public had called rescue services after noticing a canopy hung up on the wall.
Due to Sylvain jumping alone we are still awaiting video evidence after police finish their initial enquiries into his death.
Update as of 4th Oct 2021
Sylvain went to jump Pilastro in the afternoon after shitty weather in the morning.
The next are guesses and assumptions that are based on my own experience in jumping one piece tracking suit at this exit and with the FlySight data his wife gave me looking for answers.
Sylvain had a very good start (less than 300/300) and from there his glide is almost all the time between 3 and 3.5 until is suddenly goes down before he impacted.
I've experienced the same kind of conditions on this exit like in the video linked and it's very fun. I think Sylvain did not realize that he was flying slower than usual.
My guess is that at some point the thermals/winds giving him lift suddenly stopped and in that kind of situation the feeling is that you fall without any power to make a turn to bail out. He was probably too close to the edge of the cliff (if not over it) and when it happens he tried to turn with no chance of something happening, I don't know if he pitched or not but seeing where the parachute was hanging on the cliff I would guess he did and probably impacted during the opening.
Lesson to be learnt: Thermals are nice, but they can disappear in a fraction of second so when we are flying in them we are gliding more than usual flying at an opening height from the ground is the minimum we should have in the one piece tracksuit as we do not have the power a wingsuit can give,
but as a friend of mine experienced the same kind of situation over the same talus last year in a wingsuit, we shouldn't do terrain flying in case of wind or thermals even with over speed. Be safe !
P.S.: 
I'm turning left at the 30th second and I guess Sylvain did not, also I got the lift all along the flight, there are some places where if I had lost it suddenly I would have been in a very bad spot

He exited around midday from Fatal Attraction, Walenstadt on the 13th September. The camera was not found but with the information provided from REGA they picked him up at 1900msl and the exit point is at 2170msl. He was laying between the first and second ledge. Identification was done by his tattoos.
He was found the following day on the 14th September in the afternoon and could only be accessed by helicopter. We have also been asked by REGA to not attempt to get to the area to search for cameras as it’s high risk.
Lance had previously jumped Fatal Attraction in the Onesie Power and he shared the video with close friends. He explained that he was running around 95% to ensure a safe exit and track.
Another BASE jumper who was there that day mentioned the conditions were extremely turbulent and noisy to fly in with a lot of sink and lift closer to the ground. Good anabatic conditions on exit were also present.
No video footage will be reviewed but it’s been expected to either be a weak / offset / incorrect push, not enough time to get flying on a short start or not the correct conditions. This is just guess work as we will never know the exact details.
There’s lessons to be learnt here again with what’s happened, Lance’s death was preventable.
A few things I’d like to share to everyone to keep in mind or learn from…
1. Short starts with one piece suits and relying on good conditions / lift are not often repeatable. Lance was one of the most experienced one piece trackers and flew extremely well but you simply don’t have anything left in the tank compared to a wingsuit.
2. When jumping alone, contact a friend before and after the jump. Lance was not collected for more than 24 hours and it took a group of people to piece the puzzle together that he was missing.
3. With the way this has now been handled it’s good to have a plan for ourselves. Having a will or paperwork stated with what you’d like to be done will help the rescue teams, family and friends to go through the steps more efficiently with less stress.
4. Don’t trust numbers in high lift conditions. Where there’s lift, they’ll be sink as well. Best to run numbers on neutral conditions for performance based starts and always remember to take your worst start to a new exit. Always have room for human error.
5. Don’t die. BASE jumping is about living, not dying.
6. REGA, get the insurance. No excuses. Lance didn’t have insurance this year and the company has opted to cover 50% because he had it previously.
7. SBA membership. Please put an emergency contact on the form who is a family member, not a BASE jumper.
Thank you to everyone who has helped with this over the past few days. His family and close friends are still in shock but dealing with it as well as can be expected. He will be missed by everyone!
Thanks,
Sam Hardy"

The first jumper landed safely and waited for Alessandro (Bana) to check in as he planned to fly a different line to the right.
The first jumper raised the alarm after being unable to contact Bana. The rescue helicopter found him on the terrain under the exit point, at this point the most likely scenario is a problem at exit / or hitting the wall soon after exit.
Bana was a solid and cautious BASE jumper, hiking down many times when he didn’t like the conditions and was very safety focused. One theory, from the the jumper who was with him was that he exited immediately to the right and in combination with a poor exit lost control and hit the wall (similar to what happened to Paddy Frenchman) - This is just conjecture for the moment but it doesn’t hurt to remind all pilots >
ALWAYS EXIT THE CLIFF before you turn to your line, the 100 feet you save makes no difference and just adds extra risk. Push out straight, get your suit fully inflated and gain some airspeed before turning.
Bana was wearing a camera and gps but these were lost during the crash. If new information is discovered it will be added here later."

UPDATED 1ST NOV 2021
On July 10, Bryce and his mate Gabe started a BASE trip through Italy and Switzerland. By the time he died, Bryce had done between 70 and 80 wingsuit BASE jumps in one month. He was very confident and feeling great in his suit. His start numbers were impressive. Bryce was an experienced and good wingsuit pilot in skydiving but he wasn’t very experienced in BASE. When Gabe and his friend started their BASE trip, Bryce mentioned that he wanted to do more technical jumps.
On August 9, Bryce told Gabe in the morning that he felt tired and that he would join him for a jump from High Nose. Bryce changed his plan spontaneously and went up to High La Mousse to do his sixth jump from there.
We have footage from Bryce’s GoPro (chest mount) and from his Insta360 (helmet).
00:00 Exit
00:03 Bryce turns right, flying the “right line”
00:33 Disconnecting from terrain, flying towards the Alpinebase Hostel
00:45 Flare
00:48 He goes back to pull and doesn’t get the pc out, immediately tries again (2nd mispull)
00:50 Bryce is sure that the pilot chute is out and brings his arms forward for riser control
00:52 He realizes that the canopy isn’t opening and reaches back for the third time
00:54 Pilot chute is finally out (weak pull) and inflates with no hesitation next to his body
00:55 Bryce impacts with canopy out but no line stretch, primary stow still in place
A few days before the accident, Bryce and Gabe talked about mispulls in wingsuiting. Bryce said that he never had any issues pulling.
Bryce and Gabe came to Lauterbrunnen to practice their exits and starts. After jumping in the valley for a couple of days, they wanted to travel to Walenstadt to attend a course in terrain flying. Bryce got quickly bored in Lauterbrunnen and started to fly proximity.
The day before he died, two of his close friends had a chat with Bryce. They were worried about his new bad habit of pulling low. Bryce already landed in water after a low pull from Altissimo a few weeks earlier.
Bryce didn’t wear any gloves or extra layers of clothes on his last jump. He lost his life because he initiated his opening sequence too late. If he disconnected from the terrain three seconds earlier, if he started to flare and pull three seconds earlier, he would be still with us.
1. Don’t pull low. It’s just not worth it. We can all have mispulls or severe line-twists. There is always a first time.
2. Fight complacency. Don’t get too confident.
3. Listen to your close friends. If they’re worried for you, they might have a good reason.
4. Don’t jump when you’re physically or mentally tired. Long BASE trips can be very exhausting. Take a day off and relax.

He hiked up by himself, sent video and messages from the top saying it’s cold and a bit windy. He spent a lot of time jumping solo, and there was no clear check in and out procedure. By the next morning we realised he was missing and raced out to find his car at the mountain, Mountain Rescue was notified, we had an idea of where he was going to be and they quickly retrieved him.
Twenty seconds from exit to impact, it’s a positive exit into a valley. He had a good start and reached reference points on level but with less speed. Ten seconds from exit is a left corner, only then can He see the ridge that He wanted to fly over. From the corner to the ridge is ten seconds, you can only bail out to the right for the first five seconds, otherwise you get cornered in.
From the corner, he doesn’t fly straight to the ridge, he goes slightly left and flies past a outcrop that’s about five seconds from the ridge, makes a slight right turn to line up to go over the ridge and at that point he realises he is low and cornered, flares to clear it, but by that time the suit is underpowered and doesn’t have enough energy and impacts the top of the ridge.
Waldo is an amazing person! He was a true aviator, he had a Commercial Pilot License, when he wasn’t flying his wingsuit off mountains, he was flying his aircraft, landing on every little runway, when it was too windy to fly, he was kitesurfing, getting some extra air off the waves. Waldo was always humble, never flashing his experience, always ready to be on every load, always super friendly and helpful. It was an honour to have him in our lives!"

Two Jumpers hiked Pedra da Gávea to the top but it was a strong southwest wind at the exit point that’s facing northeast.
They waited about one and a half hour at the top and decided to go for another exit point on the same mountain but a bit below and facing south named Garganta do Céu.
To the left of the exit point there is another mountain that makes a wind shadow from the southwest wind making them think that it was good conditions for jumping because at the exit point there was no wind - Also called Lee side wind of mountain.
They decided to jump and it was a good opening on heading and they flew well until they leave the wind shadow and then they received the turbulence from a very strong wind (about 50km/h)
Eduardo was dragged by the wind and crashed on the balcony of an apartment and received a rotor wind being downwind of a Hotel that dropped him onto the roof of a moving car on the highway. He died a few minutes later on the spot.
The other one landed between the roads and escaped injury or death.
This fatality was highly avoidable by knowing the weather system for the day and not jump in high winds even if you have only a few days to be in that area. Both jumpers had contacted experienced jumpers but they all declined as they believed the weather conditions were not suitable.
 
 
Information from a local
 
""There's a lot of information from non-jumpers in the news regarding this accident but one thing that stands out is the fact that the ramp is used to launch paragliders and hang gliders and was closed that day due to strong winds, that ramp was very close to the Gavea exit point. It would be nice if people showing up there to jump knew that they can contact the local paragliding community and get weather feedback from them and maybe avoid future accidents like this."

We were 3 jumpers that day, the 1st jumped in a static line, then Reb prepared, he installed the static line system correctly, but we have two possible errors as to the cause of the crash.
The first hypothesis is that in the rush before the jump, he would not have made a final check on his way to the strap, he would therefore have jumped with the extraction strap passing in front of his right arm, which, at the time of the jump,
created a premature break in the break cord, and a change in that fall position that caused him to end up facing a cliff. Reb quickly released his arm strap and the puller pulled the parachute, about in the middle of the wall, Reb was supported by the parachute, but his parachute had trouble opening properly from this position face of the cliff, and the low height of the jump and especially the premature rupture of the broken cord.
The second hypothesis and that there would have been no error in the routing of the straps, but that Reb would have thrown the puller over his arm (hand thrown manner) instead of under it, also blocking the halyard around his arm.
Please, beware of any type of jump, base jumping is a very dangerous activity and, even if it is pleasant, you should never exceed your own limits.

She would later text and call several times around 2/3am sending a screen shot of his text and stating she had not heard back and was not responding to calls. A video was sent by a local jumper and restaurant owner asking if anyone could identify if it was one of our jumpers.
He is the last person I gave a hug and high five to as I left the dz due to weather, and I recognized the outfit and canopy from the video right away.
Services were held at the local dz, with full military send off for his services in the US Navy. With an ash dive by various members, to include a tandem ash dive, with his ex-wife who carried him up and pulled the pouch.
Timothy’s parents still come out to visit the dz, even years later. His father’s goal is to jump tandem one day. He stated at the services that the video taken while preparing for the jump showed him happy and excited. Which was his nature. He hopes people remember him fondly.
Timothy may have spoken to several local jumpers who participate in BASE, and didn’t have the knowledge to understand that a semi breezy spring evening, at the beach, vs 14 story building, vs a freshly downsized 150sq ft skydiving canopy, paired with drinking, and a rock filled ditch below the hotel would make for a terrible combination.
When you’re speaking with the most excitable person about BASE, please be a good mentor, and mention the serious differences in gear and their usage."

He applied for training to an inexperienced jumper who lived close to his region. They made several jumps from the antenna after Yaroslav began slider-down jumps from the cliffs. Experienced jumpers told him about the dangers of such jumps without proper training. He admitted that it was ""roulette"", but said that he hoped for his paragliding skills and psychology (this is a quote).

Fabrizio was found around 30m from the base of the cliff, canopy out but most likely from the impact.

Update :
 
After reviewing Fabrizio's GoPro we can see he had a bad exit which caused him to go very head low on exit. He immediately corrected the dive but the terrain under the exit was not sufficient for him to recover in time."

Uf was in Brento region to begin flying his Onesie Power 20. He was pleased to see me as a familiar face but we were not close friends. I’d jumped with him and his closer friends on two occasions in 2018 & 2019. He told me he had taken 2 or 3 days coaching with IBA, but I have not confirmed this as a fact. He would largely fly solo, in his own bubble, but enjoyed socialising around the packing, bus trips and hikes.
My opinion and the opinion of other jumpers, was that he was flying the suit quite well. He was noted as having a strong push from the student step on exit and consistently flew the suit to main landing.
Myself and two other more experienced friends had already jumped the Cima Capi exit on two previous days, Sunday & Monday.
Uf new of this activity and showed small interest but on both these opportunities he chose to remain jumping from Brento main exit. He seemed very adamant at that time.
By Monday evening he was requesting to join us at Pilastro.
The jump was eventful in that a jumper got twists and landed in the talus which caused apprehension at the exit for the remaining jumpers, myself, Uf and a third person.
Uf reported that he wasn’t pleased with his exit that followed, he told us he had a ‘weak push’ a little head low, but that he tracked reasonably well after.
He took a day back jumping only Brento main exit during Tuesday.
By Wednesday he learned that I and some friends planned to return to Cima Capi and requested to join us.
He messaged me and informed me that his appartment was in Riva Del Garda and he therefore would meet us at the landing.
Some of our group cancelled last minute in the morning, just through random reasons, tiredness or low motivation.
In the end there were four of us meeting at the landing tunnel. Myself and a very experienced (1900 jumps) friend with whom I had jumped Cima Capi twice already that week, then Uf and another guy (also a debutant to Cima Capi exit)
Conditions were perfect, with very calm winds forecast and a reasonably late change in direction.
The hike was very enjoyable, we were all in good spirits and having friendly relations all round. We were not rushing and took two rests. At exit everybody was calm, happy and relaxed, there were no signs of stress.
The two debutantes to Cima Capi were given the express freedom of choice in the exit order and they elected to watch my 2-piece jump and landing, followed by the other non-debutante in the Mono suit.
There was maybe a little bias towards concern for the landing pattern and accuracy requirements rather than the Exit and Freefall requirements, but all were aware of all aspects of the jump and nobody showed excessive concern or duress.
Two tourists requested to film us jumping, from a point on the via ferrata just above. All of us were more than happy and agreed it was ok.
The two debutantes decided between themselves what order they would jump, there was some talk of one of them not liking going last and Uf took the last spot willingly and without any sign of reluctance.
From the landing, 3 of us awaited Uf’s exit which seemed delayed, eventually being shocked by his unstable body, tumbling uncontrolled straight down the rock drop.
It was distressing and we immediately began declaring quite loudly that it’s looking like fatality...
We are almost 100% certain that from this point there were two quite loud impact sounds resulting in a canopy out in the resting position on the talus. Two of us were quite certain that there was no pull, and that the canopy came out due to one of these impacts... we were already however under duress and in shock.
Services were immediately informed and the body removed.
Being that I knew him more than the others and that I had witnessed the greater length of his fall, I was invited to the police station for interview.
Here, a video from one of the tourists was shown to me. I watched it through only once with no pause and found it quite distressing knowing it was my friend and so soon after the incident and so close to his final moments of life.
The video revealed a side to his demeanour that he had not really displayed or revealed to us at the exit point.
He seemed quite agitated, nervous of course but not excessively scared, but with much over deliberation about foot placements. Resetting his feet and mind often, touching his pilot chute multiple times etc etc.
After a few minutes he executed his exit as we had seen him routinely do and as his friends at home told me he always did.
His arms swing up then down and then launches from two foot static, poised.
What follows I would best describe as not a violent but definitely a strong over rotation leading to clear head low instability... it looks very obviously to anybody who BASE jumps that it is not just steep, but is entirely ‘undesirable’ and with immediate loss of control.
My recollection of this one video play through was hampered by fatigue and unmindfulness maybe however.
He disappears out of sight after a few moments and approx 5-6 seconds later a large muddled sound is heard, definitely involving an opening of fabric and at least one strong impact.
The video ends with the words ‘scheisse’ as the tourist reaches the sudden conclusion that he has impacted the cliff.
I would very very much like if possible that closer friends and possibly more experienced jumpers retrieve a copy of this video with the permission of Uf’s brother-in-law, to possibly put further accuracy on both his state of mind before exit and the execution of the push.
With love"

Conditions were good on the day, with an average amount of water flowing over the falls. The exit was chosen so to allow easy access and a good launch from rocks.
As it was a first jump Todd expressed a wish to be PCA'd. The exit was perfect. The canopy opened with an off heading 100 degrees left. As Todd corrected the off heading the edge of the canopy just made contact with the edge of the waterfall. A surge of water then struck the left end cells of the canopy, causing a collapse of the left side of the canopy. Now in a stalled configuration, the canopy was sucked into the waterfall, collapsing entirely.
The canopy stayed above Todd's head as both dropped at waterfall speed to the pool below. Todd impacted the rocks at the waterfall pool edge. He died on impact. Proximity to waterfalls is a major risk factor in this style of BASE jumping. In this case all the holes in the cheese lined up and through a combination of factors, water level, proximity, off heading and air currents.
Todd was a well experienced skydiver and excellent canopy pilot. I would urge everyone to consider the absolute worst case scenarios and calculate these when choosing to jump waterfalls.
RIP Todd. You will be sorely missed."

Sex: Male
Age: 37
Nationality: American
Equipment: Wingsuit: Colugo 3
Container: Crux
Canopy: Hayduke
This fatality is written by the speculation of the following: • Verbal ﬂight line mentioned to girlfriend before the jump
• Inspection of wingsuit, container & canopy at police station after retrieval
• Review of a photo of the body and gear where he came to rest
• Opinion of expert local jumper
• Weather conditions on the day.
• Personal inspection of the place where he came to rest
• Flying style of the jumper in the lead months leading up to the jump.
• Video from tourist from another part of the mountain.
The lead up to the jump…. David’s Base jumping journey started when he saw a video of sputnik a few years previous so for him to come here and realise his dream was a big deal that he took seriously.
He had done his ﬁrst jump here the previous day without incident in which he took a similar line but went around the outside of the pillars.
David was super ﬁt, super heathy, had a strong, clear mindset and was not hindered by drugs, alcohol or fatigue
The weather on this day was great for jumping with good lift.
David was not pushing to go jumping on this day and was happy to go paragliding with his girlfriend but she was happy for him to go for a jump in the morning which he then chose to do.
Verbal ﬂight line mentioned to girlfriend before the jump He said he will not be trying to ﬂy through the crack but to take the high left line and then head to the far left to ﬂy over the ‘trench line,’ a common line for experienced jumpers. He had promised to take it easy and come back another time after gathering data and more information on the diﬀerent ﬂight lines before getting closer to the terrain.
Inspection of wingsuit, container & canopy at police station after retrieval Review of a photo of the body and gear where he came to rest After inspection of the gear which included the wingsuit, container, pilot chute and canopy as well as photo of his body still in all gear it was determined that he died without making an attempt to
open his parachute. I did not inspect his helmet but was told of damage to the helmet. It was a full face but not CE rated.
It is unclear when his parachute came out but there was sliding dirt marks on both sides of his wingsuit and the inside of his container indicating that it was forced out after a heavy impact.
The bottom closing loop was missing completely. The top closing loop was as normal.
The left side of his canopy had a number of small holes and his pilot chute also had some small tears / holes. The right side of his wingsuit was ripped severely from the shoulder area. Apart from a major head injury, all other external injuries were on his right side.
The police photo indicates that his canopy was never deployed and was still in a semi packed state right by him.
Both his brakes were un-stowed but this could either be from the police and rescue teams or from the impact. I do not think any attempt was made to ﬂy or there was enough canopy out to even be able to ﬂy.
Opinion of expert local jumper and weather conditions on the day. After talking to a local and expert jumper who was ﬂying on that day he said that the conditions were amazing and that it was possible to ﬂy the terrain in the left line.
After reviewing the tourists video the weather looked near perfect with some light thermic wind from the edge of the cliﬀ where the video was taken as well as light ﬂuﬀy cloud indicating nice thermals.
Personal inspection of the place where he came to rest Two days after the accident and at the families request 6 of us went to try to locate the two cameras he was wearing during his jump. We went to the exact site where David came to rest using the pin location from the police. It was clear that this was not the ﬁrst point of impact. It was a small rocky area on a 45 degree slope surrounded by various vegetation directly below a very steep and narrow gully which was unreachable without climbing equipment or a mountain guide.
It is my belief that he tumbled down gully before he came to rest.
We were unable to ﬁnd the cameras.
Flying style of the jumper in the lead month leading up to the jump Davids ﬂying style was aggressive and at the top end of proximity wingsuit ﬂying in the month leading up to the accident. He was though, extremely meticulous in his training both on and oﬀ the mountain. He would ﬂy the same line repetitively working closer to the terrain. He would analyse his videos and ﬂy sight data on every single jump. But he was on the limit of ﬂying in which some other jumpers have made mention that this style of ﬂying was not sustainable.
Video from tourist from another part of the mountain The most conclusive outcome of this accident came from a tourist video from another part of the mountain. Whilst not completely clear and from far away, when zoomed in you can see him ﬂying to the second to last pinnacle, not around the outer pinnacle. You do not see him hit anything but at that moment before the tumble or steep dive you hear the shock in the voices of the 2 people doing the video.
At the 69th & 70th frames from the end of the video you see what could be a wingsuit far lower down and headed away form the pinnacle. This could also just be a bug as there is a similar image in the last 2 frames of the video also.
Speculative Conclusion: David was ﬂying with near to max glide in thermic conditions to ﬂy over the pinnacle so he could ﬂy another line to the far left.
He either….
1. Clipped a tree and tumbled to the ground
2. Stalled out with the low air speed and thermic conditions and possible wind rotors close to the pinnacles.
3. Clipped a tree and then dove down hard with a sharp right turn
4. Realised very late he wasn’t going to clear the pinnacle and performed a very sharp right turn and dive into which he impacted and or tumbled to his resting place.
Personal note: David was living on the ﬂoor below us for the last few months and we were basically house mates. We hung out every single day. We paraglided together, we base jumped together many times and i got to know him quite well, including his aggressive ﬂying style in a wingsuit. He was very conﬁdent and he ﬂew aggressively but he also trained very hard and analysed his data and video after each jump. Even though on social media he may have come across a certain way, he actually had no ego other than how stoked he was personally with the ﬂying he was achieving for himself. I would be the ﬁrst to call him out on this if I thought otherwise. He was full of awesome crazy ideas but would always listen and take note of my more cautious approach to reality which I appreciated.
I was very upset with him after hearing the news of the accident because I thought that he would’ve disregarded all his own rules and just went for it and lived in the moment after a possible good exit and good lift during ﬂight, something which I would’ve done also. But after reviewing the footage from the tourists it appears that he just went for a super high line to the left and tried to get over the top of the second to last pillar, appearing to ﬂy in a slower gliding motion to make it over although it is hard to conﬁrm because of the perspective of the camera angle.
Whilst his ﬂying style was aggressive, this is not what resulted in his death as initially thought.
Whilst he made a mistake, he held true to his word to his girlfriend and attempted what he said he was going to do.
He was one of the most full on humans I have ever met and the most honest, true and virtuous person I have ever met who’s ultimate dream was to help change and save the world. I was proud to call him my friend.

This was his first time seeing the mountain in person and jumping the object. Jeremiah’s last Wingsuit BASE jump was in Italy 11/6/19. Between then and the jump on the 3rd of September he had made another 200 Wingsuit skydives.
Exit Altitude: 775’ rock drop, 3600’ to lz.
Conditions: 62° clear sunny skies
Wind on exit: Light wind up the face from sun exposure.
Description:
Details would be that Jeremiah took a left line from East Buttress toward the classic attempting to fly over the notch, impacting while flying too low to clear the notch. Canopy partially coming out after impacting and reaching line stretch several hundred feet down the gully where he came to rest. The individual that was on exit with him had jumped first and after realizing what had happened, not having a emergency locator beacon or cell service, ran 30 minutes down trail to his vehicle so that he can drive about 20 minutes to cell service and make the distress call. The SAR Helicopter came as quickly as possible eventually locating his body with no signs of life, they decided to resume the recovery the following day. A team of 4 Search and Rescue members were lowered down to recover his body and later taken to the medical examiner’s office.
UPDATED 10TH AUGUST 2024
This is from the jumper that was with Jeremiah. The information in the initial report is second hand information and is inaccurate in one regard: Jeremiah did not ask non-stop on the way up about the notch. If I had asked Jeremiah specifically what line he intended to fly on exit, I believe he would have told me, and had I suggested to do something else, I am highly confident he would have followed my guidance. The biggest lesson for me from this incident is that the pre-jump fist bump is a sacred moment where we check-in with our companions; it is a moment to check-in with folks, reflect, and possibly suggest a change of plans if something feels off.  We took a little over 3 hours to hike up and most of that was talking about non-BASE topics. Another friend had asked me to show Jeremiah the Baring exit.
I had told that friend that I only knew how to get to the East buttress exit and did not know how to get to the classic exit which is considered better for people who are tracking and visiting Baring for the first time. My friend vouched that Jeremiah had sufficient ws base experience for the East buttress exit so there was no need to figure out how to get to the classic exit. The hike up was my first time meeting Jeremiah so we easily filled the time hiking up learning about each other and exchanging stories.At around the halfway mark Jeremiah asked me what my flight plan was for the jump. I shared with him I intended to fly through a jumper’s left notch that I had done once before but was quite technical. He asked if I had laser numbers for the notch, and I shared that I didn’t. I had went for the notch for the first time relying on sight picture to make a quick decision to abort or commit. He asked if I thought it would be possible to fly through the notch with a freak2, I told him I did not know but the correct way to assess would be with a laser and gps data. I suggested there were other nice flight options going straight or right.When we were near the rock gully, he once more asked about the notch and whether it would be possible to do with a freak2. I explained the other factor that you’d need to consider is that it’s a push with a subterminal left turn, so you’d need to have data from past jumps where you immediately do a subterminal turn off exit.
My impression was that he was inquiring with curiosity to know if on some future distance jump if it would even be possible to fly through the notch with a freak2.Both discussions were short and given my answers, I didn’t consider flying the same line would be something on his mind. I didn’t see any red flags in anything he communicated. I’ve been on hikes with jumpers before who seem to have a superhuman belief in themselves that is worrisome, this was not Jeremiah. With regards to climbing, he seemed to have been going beyond the training that many BASE jumpers do, myself included, to become a competent climber. And he seemed to be eager for advice + feedback on how to be as competent of a pilot as possible.The pre-jump exit atmosphere was quiet but nothing felt off. Jeremiah shared he would prefer to jump second. I geared up and walked close to the edge to start visualizing for my own flight and then realized I had forgotten to do a fist bump as is customary, so I turned around to raise my fist in the hopes Jeremiah would take steps towards me to meet the fist bump. He gave me a nervous chakra instead and in that moment I felt that something was wrong, but I ignored that instinct to return to visualizing my flight. As I put my feet over the ledge, Jeremiah interjected to ask if I would mind if he stood to the left, behind me, and slightly over me. I told him I did not mind, did my countdown and jumped. Shortly after landing I looked up to see if I could watch his flight and started to connect the pieces, I then watched him exit and fly towards the notch. I couldn’t see exactly what happened but heard several thuds. From this point on the rest of the first incident report is accurate.
I knew something was wrong at the fistbump check-in and I ignored that instinct. If people are so nervous or the vibe is so off, that the fist bump is forgotten, this is a red flag. If the fist bump happens, but you can feel your own energy or another person’s energy is off, this is a red flag. I should have stopped and asked Jeremiah how he was feeling when he threw the nervous chakra. I think it’s likely he would have told me he was nervous and revealed his plan if I had asked his flight plan. That would have been my opportunity to suggest he fly something different and that the notch would always be there. I know this would likely have worked, because I’ve been in similar situations since.
Sometimes we trap ourselves into a plan and all that it takes to help get us out of the trap is if a friend suggests an alternative.  
Two lessons:
(1) fist bump is sacred. Check-in with your partner here and be prepared to take a step back from the edge if the vibe is off
(2) always ask about your partner’s flight plan on exit. Even competent rational people have moments of poor judgement that we would not expect."

UPDATE 3RD JANUARY 2021:
 
Report: Kim Gonsholt’s fatality at Skåla, 15th July 2020 at 20:35
Gonsholt jumped as the last of a group of three. All three jumped solo. Separation between
jumper one and two was 65 seconds. Between jumped two and Gonsholt separation was 12
seconds. It was the first time for Skåla to be basejumped.
Equipment:
Jumper 1: Squirrel WS Aura 4
Jumper 2: Phoenix Fly Sukhoi 2020
Jumper 3: Squirrel WS CR+ (Base version)
Conditions:
Low sun straight into the wall. Light laminar winds from north west (straight into the wall). 1
– 3 mps anabatic push. Light anabatic push throughout the whole flight line towards landing
area.
Location:
Skåla, 1852masl. Exit point is at 1835masl.
There are two landing options: Bottom of the valley, large field at 40 masl or halfway down
at a river aprox 900masl. Distance to the bottom landing area is 4,5km, while distance to the
other landing are at 900m is 1,7km.
Exit:
Critical point is 90/30. Solid rock to stand on and the wall is clean and open.
Before jumping, a reference point at approximately 370/600 along the line was identified. If
this point was not reached with good horizontal speed, the plan was to abort an attempt to
reach bottom valley landing and rather fly to the river at 900masl. Both first jumpers flew to
the bottom landing at 40masl. This report is written by jumper 1. Report writer flew by
reference point in good speed and therefore chose to fly all the way down. Only report
writer and Gonsholt was wearing camera.
This is the description of Gonsholt’s jump, based on Flysight data and POV from GoPro Max:
After 100m vertical, he had flown 41m horizontal. After 200m vertical, he had flown 140m
horizontal. At 400m vertical he had covered 610m, his horizontal speed was 165kph with a
glide ratio (GR) of 3,1 (this was 20sec into the flight). This put him below the critical inflight
reference point with at that point 165kph horizontal speed. He chose to keep on flying
towards the bottom landing. Altitude from this point until the end of flight was between 3-
15 meters. After 30 seconds his horizontal speed was 145kph, at 40sec – 135kph, at 50sec –
125kph, at 60sec – 109kph and finally at 68sec – 81kph. Gonsholt emergency pulled after
70sec of flight, impacted on line stretch and died immediately. Observations from video
shows his configuration to be fully stretched, top to toe, with neutral to light anhedral arm
setup throughout the flight.
Skåla has been discussed for years by many experienced wingsuit pilots, but never jumped
before, for obvious reasons. It was finally opened after several recce hikes and a long wait
for perfect conditions. Gonsholt has performed around/above 200 wingsuit BASE jumps and
was known for substantial talent with impressive dynamic skills and high-speed lines. His
experience in exit opening was low. The two other jumpers have together more than 40
years in BASE jumping and a history of opening exit points going back to the early 2000’s.
So why did this go so wrong?
Critical control questions about experience level, skills and overall awareness was never
asked. Recent history of impressive achievements perhaps made it less natural to put on the
caring mentor hat towards Gonsholt. The ability to understand when to bail flight seems
challenging. It’s clear from GPS data and POV camera that the higher landing area was the
only option for survival. He impacted just halfway down, and it is not getting steeper from
that point and downward. We knew this in advance. The trail to the top is going up where
you fly down. It is a demanding GR to the very end.
It is easy to sit in front of a computer with GPS and camera data, and analyze what could
have been done differently, and so hard in freefall.
The joy on landing lasted for one minute. After that, Skåla as a wingsuit exit, turned into a
very different story. But, truth is that both jumpers had a bad gut feeling hanging under
canopy. Skåla was just as marginal, and maybe even more, than it was assessed to be in
advance.
Kim Gonsholt was 26 years old and lived in his campervan travelling around jumping when
he was home from off-shore work. It was a setup that allowed him to jump a lot and
therefore have a steep learning curve.
He made an impact with his big smile and 100 % commitment to reach as far as he could in
the sport. He would have wanted all of us to see this report, just as he carefully read all BASE
Fatality List reports to learn and be safer.
Kim will be deeply missed."

First the cause of the incident is a bridle under the arm when the PC is released
Second the helmet was not attached or properly attached as the chin-lock was open when found and the jumper lost is helmet before opening, which gives an outside view of the incident.
He exited and had a non effcient track but nothing very unstable.
At some point (36th second of the video) he's changing his position (box) to pitch and he losts his helmet while getting the PC out. He tries to recover it by putting his hand on his head but the helmet is already gone, we can see that he already grabed the PC by the handle.
The helmet turns and shows the all bridle out and the all the PC in the wind still grabed by the handle.
The camera losts sight and get it back (still 36th second of the video)and the PC is now in the front of the arm and the bridle, a moment later he left the PC go.
My guess is that he probably kept the PC in the hand because he was thinking of his helmet, and the air perturbations had made the PC turning around the arm followed by the bridle.
The camera losts sight again and when it got back on him for 2 frames (37th second of the video) the right arm looks like he is trying to do something but we cannot see the PC inflated.
The camera losts sight again, it got back on him (38th second of the video) and something that looks like the inflated PC but he his already far from the camera.
The next 2 times (39th and 40th seconds of the video) we can see him it is very hard to see what's happening but I would guess that he is trying to do something.
And then (41st second of the video) he is on the ground.
Lessons to be learnt:
Never keep the bridle in your hand, if you go for pitching do it fully whatever is happening.
Check your gear, 1, 2, 3, ... how many times needed (whatever people are saying).
Think about what you would do if you were in the same situation now, and train it mentally and on the ground, so the day you need it you will do it fast."

We took our time gearing up and I discussed my flight path with Alex. He was unsure if he would take the left or right line, and opted to jump after me, offering to film my exit. As we made our way down to the exit he told me he'd be a bit behind me as he still had not decided which line to fly. I had a safe jump and landing and waited in the LZ. I was unable to have a clear visual of the exit or of the lines he would have flown.
I waited for ten minutes before becoming concerned, gave it another five, and decided it was too long for him to be waiting on the exit. There was minimal cell reception on exit and none in the LZ so I drove ten minutes down the road and called him: it rang but no answer which told me that he was no longer on exit but not far enough down to be out of cell reception. I called search and rescue immediately. At this time there is no footage to verify the cause of death, but based on previous flights and the location of his body we can assume he impacted mid flight after a very committing and aggressive turn into a drainage.
Alex had opened up several big wingsuit jumps in this area in the past few years and had big plans of opening more. He flew these jumps with commitment and intensity and recognized that pushing further would be unsustainable. He talked constantly of the potential here and his passion for exploration in the mountains and opening exits. His last week of life was spent enjoying the fruits of his labour: flying wingsuits in the mountains with friends.
He will be extraordinarily missed, and I'm sorry for those of you who are learning of this now on a fucking facebook page.
Though it breaks my heart to write this, I am eternally grateful to have had these last precious days and moments with Alex.
**Things I've thought about:
-we should have each clarified our flight plan with each other prior to exit
-we should have had radios; had I known when he was jumping I could have wasted less time wondering
-if I had binoculars in my van I could have seen him on the exit or where he came to rest, giving me more detailed information to pass to SAR"

In order to prepare himself for a new jump he wanted to open they both had been practicing on that cliff where if we jumped straight all is safe and good but if we go for the right there is a medium ledge.
JB had done already a few right lines over the ledge.
On the fatal one he jumped to the right again and had a slightly steep exit but nothing to worry about.
After he cleared the exit he applied a very sharp bank to the right but it seems it was too aggressive as this manoeuvre sent him in too steep and head low very sideways.
Despite all of this he recovered and still continued to the right but he was to low and hit the trees on the ledge."

We hiked at a normal pace on a short approach and arrived in good shape. We measured both potential exits, including the one we knew had already been open and which Luc jumped. We all agreed to go on this exit as the numbers were easier (+10m total vertical). It is still a pretty challenging exit with a -20+6m ledge to clear.
He jumped first, after looking down and telling us he felt confident.
Exit happened at 11h30 with perfect weather conditions, without wearing a camera.
Luc experienced a weaker push than usual on a less than forgiving exit.
We heard the impact a couple seconds later. He has most probably hit the first ledge below.
We found his body 200m down the exit.
Luc had 14 years of base-jumping experience, and more than 1200 jumps, he was used to technical exits and mountain access, he opened plenty of them. He was current in jumping, as no real ban was enforced in most of Switzerland, he was keeping the activity low profile though.
He was a kind friend and will deeply missed by the Swiss community. Our thoughts to his family.
Other possible external factors:
-we brought crampons as the snow conditions required them on previous weeks, and we didn’t know what to expect for the north path approach. It might have tightened the suit and reduced his movements capabilities, I remember seeing his suit pockets pretty filled on previous jumps."

Luca Barbieri's GoPro video.
The GoPro has been delivered to us by his girlfriend.
She was with Luca but was unable to see the jump because she was driving the car to go to pick up Luca from under the bridge.
His GoPro was mounted on his helmet.
After careful analysis we are able to ascertain that the fatality was cause by a feet wrap in his bridle during a Static line jump.
From his video POV we see that the SL setup is correct, just that the static cord loop used to fix the system to the bridge is too long for this kind of spot.
Luca had not stowed the bridle excess that there is between the two break cord loops and all system it turned out too long, with too excess of bridle and static cord free to move around.
He jumped with the PC far off his body, in his right hand, pulled just a bit on the right side during the exit.
Immediately after the exit, 2 meters below, his body turned quickly on the left side.
We see that the primary break cord is broken and the second one is still attached to the bridge.
His right foot unfortunately is already wrapped around the bridle excess between the two break cords.
When the second break cord breaks he it's already in free fall and on his back with one pin out but with the bridle entanglement around his body till the impact that happens 3 seconds later.
In our opinion the mistake was to not stow the bridle excess between the two break cords with a rubber band and make too long the static cord. That made the entire system to long and more easy to wrap accidently around something.
During the exit he flexed too much his legs on his ass, intercepting the bridle.
His girlfriend told us that before this jump, he had done another jump from a 260 metre antenna (Slider ON) that he climbed during the night. Then he packed slider down and drove in the direction of the bridge.
Maybe he was tired and we feel it also in the bridge video where he looks more stressed then usual.
I have seen many mistakes about SL jumps in 20 Years of career, far more dramatic then Luca's but solved only with a big scare.
Luca was really unlucky because all things that could go wrong went wrong.
Luca was a cool guy, super humble with an incredible talent.
With his wing-suit he was a real Master.
I can ascertain that his skills on Slider up jumps were better than his slider down but for sure he was not unprepared just certainly unlucky.
I know that Luca had more than 1300 Skydiving WS jumps and around 800+ BASE jump, mainly with wing-suit.
The weather conditions were good with sun and zero wind.
I hope that this details could help for people to pay more attention at any detail during the SL jumps.
We have reports the deceased was jumping with one onlooker who is not a base jumper, we are waiting to hear back from police reports.

Great visibility, north wind in the area, we made it to the exit point easily and we were not tired after the 2+ hours hike. We decided to go for a two way wingsuit jump and I was jumping second, behind the deceased jumper. This exit point can be quite intimidating, a correct push with proper heading is very important, there are clearly visible powerlines a few hundred meters below the exit point and this can make people nervous, but the deceased had already jumped from this exit point in the past and he looked ok at the exit, quite focused and committed.
He jumped first and I followed, half second later. His exit looked fine, normal push, correct heading, no drastic change of angle in the recovery arc, he seemed ok, but lower than me in the early phase of the jump. A few seconds later, as he was flying toward the first ledge to the left, he made a drastic 90° turn to the right, possibly to avoid flying too close to this ledge, he then corrected his heading by turning again 90° left, back on the normal flight path, but he was, at this point, flying very low and pretty slow. He kept flying straight toward powerlines for several seconds, but unfortunately he was not high enough to fly past them and impacted on one of them, tumbling for another hundred meters until he came to a rest in the forest."

Finally, we found a day with a perfect forecast and low water level in the reservoir. We got up early to arrive to the place half hour before a sunrise. We were 3 jumpers.
In the middle of the dam there is a fixed crane overhanging 10m from where a local company offers bungee jumping services. In the bottom, just below the crane there is a water exit to a pool. This pool extends some 60m from the dam wall and after is our primary landing zone. The pool itself is a very dangerous zone because of the water stream coming from the reservoir. To the left and right of the pool there are some small places where we could also land in case of emergency. The laser measurements gave us 95m from the top to the water. After the pool we gain vertically around 10m more.
We went down to inspect the landing. Just after the pool was some low water safe landing. 60m after the pool was dry road and this is where we were heading as a main landing area. To the right from the exit point was our first emergency landing zone. To the left there wasn't much room to make a safe landing, but it was still better than landing into the pool (something consensuated by all before jumping).
Shortly after we went back to the top, geared up and climbed to the edge of the crane. The feel was of no wind. We had a tiny branch each, I dropped mine and it went down in a straight vertical line. We all decided going hand-held, me first, after Riki (the rookie of the group) and then the last one. My jump went perfect, hand-held, 1 sec delay, on-heading opening and landing in the main landing area, even further than expected (approximately 140m from the dam wall). Then Riki jumped, hand-held, 1 sec delay with good body position but he had a 90º off-heading opening to the left. He corrected the heading with rear risers losing considerable vertical altitude without moving forward to the landing area; taking some precious seconds to let go his breaks. When he finally released them, he was low, but still decided to go forward for the main landing zone (we guess he thought he will make it). Unfortunately for all, he couldn’t manage to pass the pool and landed into the left corner, just few meters before its edge. The strong water stream made him disappear and we couldn’t see him anymore.
It’s very difficult to tell why he wouldn’t let go the breaks sooner. Both human and gear factors may had some influence. Riki was a young, full of life and kindness, enthusiastic jumper. He will be deeply missed by all the family, friends and local skydive-BASE community members. Fly free, brother."

Nothing particular at the exit, no wind, no slippery rock, us smiling and concentrating on the jump as usual. We decide to jump in two way, me behind him.
After the exit I see something is wrong with Pierre. His left leg is straight, but his right leg was bent (too much force on the exit?. It offsets it on the right edge when he got into the track position, turn to the right, off center even more, he kicked his legs in the bend and this put him on his back and then he impacted after 6 sec against the cliff in half-face track on the back. His parachute opened on impact, which took him down the cliff. He died instantly. He did not suffer. He was accompanied to the end.

Update :
It was his first molaire in a one piece track suit for Gerome.
He had got the briefing that we always give to the people here for the first time.
""On the last part before arriving at the power lines, you need to take a crucial decision.
Either you have speed and you see you are going to make the landing area easy and you continue, or you have a small doubt, you pull and you try again next time""
From outside view, gerome lost his speed and decided to keep going anyway ...
Between the power lines and the road he was too low to pull, so he waited to pass the road and pull after.
Unfortunately, he was too low and impacted at line stretch.
Over the last few seasons Gerome has mainly jumped only ""short"" jump, jump lauterbrunnen style, 20-25s where people are used to build up speed, release all the speed and then when run out of speed it s time to pull.
Unfortunately, this is a mistake which happened alot lately with the one piece tracker.
Then when they come to jump were the ""crux"" is around 30s they often already lost their speed.
Please people take a lesson from this, take the time to get used to longer flight before attempting commiting jumps
Gerome was a very respected montain guide and very nice human, this is a huge loss.
Gerome was the most experience of our group with a life time of expertise in the mountains."

Brandon was a conservative jumper so we are now awaiting for his gear to be inspected.
Update 15th Sept
At approximately 2pm on Monday, September 9, Brandon Chance was killed in a BASE jumping accident at the Perrine Bridge, in Twin Falls, Idaho, USA. He was an extremely experienced jumper who had been BASE jumping for more than a decade, and had made more than 700 BASE jumps. He was also an extremely experienced professional skydiver, who had made more than 18,000 skydives.
This jump was a two way with his wife. Brandon took the low slot. Brandon was flat and stable in free fall, and had a good view of the other jumper’s exit and deployment. He maintained a flat and stable body position and intentionally took a very deep (approximately 4 seconds) delay. The jump plan called for Brandon to open low and land in the lower (beach) landing area, so that the entire upper landing area was clear for the other jumper.
Brandon made his initial attempt to throw his pilot chute at approximately 4 seconds, reaching back with one hand in a normal slider down deployment motion. He encountered some difficulty in deploying the pilot chute. Unfortunately the only video of the incident is a relatively low quality phone video shot from the exit point, and examination of the video does not reveal the nature of his deployment difficulty. The video shows definite movement of his right hand to the BOC, and then motion of his arm and shoulder in an attempt to throw. It is unclear if he experienced a hard pull, a missed pull, a fumble of the PC, or some other difficulty.
After his first failed attempt to initiate deployment, Brandon brought both hands to the BOC, in a “wingsuit pitch” motion, with his left hand moving symmetrically in to the left side of the BOC. He gave one leg kick during this motion, but remained in a stable, belly to earth position. He threw the pilot chute smoothly at approximately 5.1 seconds of delay. The PC inflated immediately with no evidence of hesitation, opening the container and bringing the canopy to line stretch.
The canopy experienced nose expansion, but did not complete pressurization prior to impact. The final video frame before impact shows the canopy with a fully open nose, but with the tailgate still in place.
On gear inspection, the tailgate was no longer closed around the lines, but it is unclear if the tailgate released prior to impact, or at some point during the rescue attempt and gear recovery.
There was no evidence of gear malfunction either in video review or in post-incident gear inspection."

He was pronounced dead at 12pm. Dylan didn't make the planned LZ and the second jumper didn't know that he had been hurt or died until the police told him after his arrest.

Update 25th Sept 2019
Ground crew saw that Dylan's poised exit was unstable and he rotated forward after exit. He pitched mid-rotation and had an off-heading opening/line twists. He struck the object and an adjacent building under canopy several times before his canopy collapsed, dropping him several stories to the ground. Video shows him alive but non-responsive when the police arrive on the scene. Dylan died a few hours after the jump in emergency surgery with 20+ broken bones, multiple organ failure, and lots of internal bleeding.
Dylan typically wore a fair amount of PPE when jumping (rated helmet, knee/elbow pads, boots, gloves), but those weren't enough for the impacts on the object or substantial fall to the ground. Adding a D30 backpad or spine protector wouldn't have done much given the nature of his injuries.

This report was obtained by reviewing the deceased’s helmet mounted video.
The jumper performed a 9 second delay with reasonable track. On deployment the canopy opens off heading to the right but then immediately starts rotating hard to the left, completing a rotation approximately every 2 seconds. A large tension knot between the left brake line and rear left line group is visible in the helmet video footage.
The jumper tries pumping the rear risers in turn without effect. The jumper pulls down the left and right brake toggle without effect. The canopy continues in a rapid spiral decent to the left. The jumper appears to flare the canopy and stops the rotation but then the canopy starts turning again to the left and strikes the talus. The canopy flies away but continues to rotate and this time strikes the talus head on, the jumper becomes entangled in the canopy and slides / falls down the steep talus wrapped in their canopy.
Emergency services were called and upon arrival she was found deceased.

Unable to locate pilot chute and / or possible hard pull / Low pull resulting in terminal impact on ground.
Jon was an active skydiver and expert paraglider pilot with great awareness of his body and his surroundings.
He was a very safe and confident BASE jumper and he always opened high to the point where others would joke about it with him.
He had done over 30 skydives, 10 balloon jumps and multiple helicopter jumps in the Mutation Hybrid suit before taking it BASE jumping from Monte Brento and then Lauterbrunnen.
He mentioned how easy the pull was in the mutation Hybrid suit.
He had good exits in Monte Brento although his flights were slow.
Detailed description :
The incident took place on Jons second jump of the day, his first jump was uneventful had an ok exit and high pull as usual.
On last jump one of the instructors asked Jon if he was happy with the way he had his PC as the instructor said he is not happy with the way it looked but everything was routed correctly and Jon did not seem phased
Jon exited a little head high which then pushed him head low and off axis for a couple of seconds. At this point most of the group except one instructor lost sight of him after a few seconds he came back into view and he was in a stable body position and flying well and a very safe distance away from the wall.
As per normal with Jon he went to deploy at a very safe altitude it was then the group could see something was wrong and that he began to struggle to either locate the pilot chute or extract the pilot chute. He continued to locate/extract his pilot chute which he did just before impact which was at a very high speed at this point. It was clear this was a fatal and the group immediately went into emergency procedures.
It was clear that Jon had impacted on his back side on the upper legs lower back region due to the large dirt stains. He had bounced roughly 10 metres from the initial impact point and was laying face down. His canopy was at line stretch but it was clear that this was from the impact as the bottom closing loop was missing and the top closing loop was broken in 2.
Members on the ground had filmed his flight and after review it was said” Jon initiated the deployment sequence at a more than safe altitude with a stable flare and that made several attempts to either locate or extract the pilot chute. Whilst still fighting he was kicking his legs as went into a steep and very fast dive”. The video did not film the impact but witnesses say that he went into a front loop as such as he finally deployed his pilot chute at approximately 30-40 feet before impact.
Short statement on the way his PC was Packed.
“It was fully stuffed into the BOC with only the carbon fibre tubular, hollow handle sticking out. LTBJ do not recommend this way of packing or jumping a pilot chute as the bulkiest part of the pilot chute is on the inside of the elastic on the BOC.
Jon was a great human being and a fun guy to be around he was fit both physically and mentally and he was current at air sports. He was a great addition to the LTBJ family and we are devastated by what has happened.

Information is that this jump is normally jumped early in the morning due to stronger coastal winds, this jump was performed during the warmer parts of the day.
The exit in question can be seen in the link below at 1:11 min mark."

He was jumping alone which he did occasionally. Before he jumped he sent a GPS track of his hike with co-ordinates of the new exit and a photo of the view looking down from the exit. He said it was a 5 second rock drop.
After not receiving further contact from Krzysztof and feeling that something was wrong, 2 of his friends drove from Romsdalen to Sunndalsøra. They checked the landing area and then found his van unattended at the start of the hike.
The Police were called and a rescue helicopter quickly located his body underneath the exit. They had the GPS co-ordinates to help them. No helmet or camera was recovered. Krzysztof died instantly from a severe head injury.
On inspecting his equipment and body it was noted that his wingsuit zippers were not done up. Left arm was zipped to the elbow, right arm not zipped at all. Booties were on but leg zips not done up. The rescue team believes he had his helmet on, but chin strap not fastened. His rig was on with leg straps and chest strap tightened.
Krzysztof died from a tragic accident falling from the cliff before he was fully geared up in his wingsuit. It was a 5 second rock drop and he has not been able to pull his pilot chute before impacting directly below the exit. Speaking to the rescue personnel they said the area at the top of the cliff looked flat. It was not a rappel or sketchy to access the exit. At the time of jumping it was sunny with dry rock.
Krzysztof was a very dedicated, motivated wingsuit BASE jumper. He was a rock climber for 12 years before he started BASE. He was good at finding exits using topographical maps and was a strong hiker. After an intial hasty progression in BASE, he had matured and slowly built his skills and experience over a number of years. He was constantly improving and had become a skilled wingsuit pilot.
He was a quiet character and would come across as shy, but once you got to know him he was funny, thoughtful, generous and a wonderful man. He will be greatly missed."
Jean Andre Quemener,UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND,30,2019-06-08,4,550,350,400,200,Italy,BASE Fatality,Earth,Impact in terminal freefall,"Aura 2, Expert Wingsuit by Squirrel","270 Ibex, 7 Cell - Vented by Squirrel","Stream, 2 Pin by Squirrel","Slider Up, BOC, BOC","Hot with thermals producing, Sunny",Proximity flying,"Jean was attempting a flight from Sass Pordoi Cross and fly back to the gondola station. His exit was witnessed by another jumper from the exit. He had a good start and flew with good glide high on the left ridge. He was seen to turn left and disappeared behind the ridge. He was not seen under canopy, but on previous similar flights had landed his parachute out of view from the exit so it did not seem unusual to the 2nd jumper.
Jumper 2 did a jump and landed in the main landing area in the valley on the right from exit. During their flight they had good lift and smooth air, but had some bumpy air under canopy. After landing, jumper 2 was unable to contact Jean. After not finding him at his van at the gondola station and not being able to contact him rescue was called.
The rescue helicopter located Jean in the snow at the bottom of the wall on the right side of the ridge. He impacted in flight, died instantly and fell down a few hundred metres to come to rest in the snow at the top of the talus. His parachute container was closed with no canopy out and the pilot chute still stowed. He was wearing a chest mount gopro camera, however the camera has broken off on impact and was not found by the rescue team. The area to search for the camera is in a difficult to access area with avalanche danger.
Jean was very happy and full of life during the last month. He had purchased a campervan and was living his dream camping and flying in the Dolomites"
Markus Anhorn,SWITZERLAND,27,2019-06-07,8,,,,,Norway,BASE Fatality,Earth,Drowning,"Freak, Expert Wingsuit by Squirrel","265 OSP, 7 Cell - Vented by Atair Aerodynamics","LD3, 2 Pin by Adrenalin BASE","Slider Up, BOC, BOC","Sunset, Winds light and variable",Altitude awareness,"Description: Marcus was an experienced canopy pilot, flying paragliders and speedwings (also in competitions) from his teenage years. Earlier in 2019 he finished his USPA tandem licence and was current in both canopy handling and wingsuit flying prior to his trip to Norway. He was otherwise physically fit and healthy.
This was his first jumping day of his Norwegian vacation and 3rd WS jump of the day. It was a two way - Marcus was leading the same line flown by Jokke Sommer in «slope flying in Stryn» video (but done conservatively). Prior to the flight there was established visual and audio contact with the landing area (the road to Flo), where his younger sister and a local family of 3 were waiting. Marcus deployed right above them, while 2nd jumper continued his flight and pulled over the lake (Oppstrynsvannet). After deployment 2nd jumper turned his canopy around, unzipping while flying towards the road. Marcus was doing the same while flying in the opposite direction away from the road. The landing area is 20-30 meters above the lake. The whole stretch of shoreline consist of big boulders, high drops and medium high forest on a very steep terrain - there is no alternative landing area between the road and the lake. After finishing unzipping and making a 180 turn towards the road, Marcus was to low to reach it. Judging from the video he then chooses to go for the water and land along/near the shoreline. He lands at the depth of 1,5 meters, 2 meters away from a high vertical rockface and 10 meters away from the spot where there is possible to climb up the terrain. No shouting or splashing was heard by people at the landing area.
The rescue operation started immediately from the time he disappeared behind the tree line at the planed landing area. His sister got to him first followed by one of the spectators and the 2nd jumper. Marcus was floating face down, covered by his canopy with his helmet pulled off. He was dragged to the shore and CPR (with 30 compressions and 2 breath) was started right away. Approximate time from when he landed till he was pulled ashore and given CPR was about 3-5 minutes. Rescue team was contacted by the spectators family when Marcus was located, the team came 20 minutes later and continued the CPR process, trying also different types of heart starters. Marcus was picked up by the helicopter 1,5 hour after accident and flown to the nearest hospital, he was declared dead 4 hours after the jump. Local police forces and the county of Stryn representatives did their best effort to help and follow up on everyone involved around this fatality.
Marcus was a very energetic soul with a big heart and love for adventure. He was dearly loved by his family, friends and his military colleagues. The church was packed, with people lining outside on the day of his funeral. He is deeply missed.

During his first trip (FJC + Brento) he made 47 jumps, his track was very good. He improved it quickly and sometimes opened lower than he should. He was warned about it by his mentor (Semjon Lazarev) and other jumpers.
Last jump Alexey made with Semjon and we have information from him. Alexey was the second in 2-way, but in free fall he overtook Semjon and was ahead. Semjon opened and saw Akexey's attempt to open. In his words, the height of the first attempt was about 80 meters from the ground. For an unknown reason, Alexey could not open immediately and impacted before linestretch.
Maybe he missed PC, or his hand slipped off. Also handle on his PC was open, and we know cases when a finger stucked in it.
+ 20-30 meters could save him.
We can only repeat the old truths:
Low pull = danger!
PC problem = danger!
Low pull + PC problem = death.
He will be missed by the Russian crew."

Update 3rd January 2019
There is no 100% clear idea as to what happened to Stew... even after watching the video from his GoPro (front facing), reviewing the pictures taken by the Police, and inspecting the gear. Stew had a good flight, a clear movement for pull can be seen on the video, no struggle or panic after, and stable flatter flight till impact. The lower closing loop was torn from the impact, and the canopy came out behind him on the ground. Slider was still up and the PC was out flat (bridal stretched, no knots or entanglement, and not packed as if it just slid out of the pouch). From this point on, all we can do is assume that the PC had some sort of hesitation, snag, etc.
I'll mark this up to the 1% unknown factor on a base jump, that can screw everything up. Stew was a very calculated person, months away from achieving his PhD in Neuroscience at the Zurich University"

Coming from one of his jumping buddies who obtained the information from those jumping with him.
Disclaimer: I was not present that day, but am friends with the 2 flyers whom were. I flew with him almost everyday for 3 months in 2018, and for 2 prior seasons.
As everyone knows, Gwill charged hard, & at the end of his 2018 season he was really pushing it on certain lines that he wanted to ‘put a stamp on.’ On exit that day, he declined a 2-way with an experienced terrain flyer b/c said flyer wouldn’t be ‘charging hard enough’ [that flyer is pretty gnarly, so we know Gwill’s frame of mind that day was full-on.] I think this was his 1st time flying Stockhorn. Gwill wasn’t much of a ‘marker’ guy, & didn’t often study/memorize others’ lines/markers. I do know he had reviewed some footage of the line though. Gwill was open to criticism, he often said his ‘ego’ was his main weakness; thus, he was often [& knowingly] too stubborn to actually fly with more margin for safety [I reminded him of it weekly for 3 months of flying.] With that said, as the season passed he actually was adapting to go less hard...ish, but ‘less hard’ for Gwill was still 10% more than acceptable by most. Many times while watching his footage on certain lines I muttered to him, ‘Duuude, that was insane, you know, if you flew 10% less than that, it would STILL BE insane AND pretty much perfect.’ But Gwill was a supernova, & he wanted to scorch everything he flew. So, yes, he always wanted to fly closer, in order to fly what he believed was: the perfect line. The way he flew was how he dreamed of flying. He lusted for those quick s-turns at the lowest depths of gorge flights. And that’s how he flew his last line at Stockhorn. Supernova.
Below are some random [not Gwill’s] screenshots from diff vids of the line, & the general vicinity (between 1. & 4.) of where he impacted. The 1. arrow is the entrance to the line, the red circle is a flyer [to get a visual of proportions.] I assume the impact would be around the yellow line in 2. & 3. Tight corners deep in there. The exact impact location is a relatively minor detail, he was most likely turning [& possibly drifting] too deep for that whole section [especially for a 1st flight there.]
I’ll also add a chopped up conversation we had days before his death; to illuminate his willingnesses to learn to charge less hard [w/ my reply of the only -& often repeated to him- advice that matters in this game: don’t die. Most dont know the evolution of his mind-set that summer, and how he was starting to chill out. They know him from his wildness pre-2018. Throughout the season, I watched him evolve into flying with 10% more margin, bail on lines during flight, poor-weather hike-off the mountain, get nervous, be afraid, have nightmares about the next days’ flights when we knew we were gonna charge hard, and sometimes fly super chill. But, unfortunately, he still flew that 110%...once in a while.
Regardless, HE MOTHERFUCKING LOVED TO FLY. His technical way of flying that summer was beautiful [some see danger / we see beauty.] He had become quite the advanced flyer, but few really knew the extent of it, cuz he didn’t share his vids [unlike many of the cacklers out there judging his wild style.] And why did he not share his vids like many of the cavilling keyboard nannies out there...cuz HE MOTHERFUCKING LOVED TO FLY. And in his last moment, he was doing just that."

I am uncertain whether he had planned to do aerials or if it was a last minute decision as it wasn’t mentioned prior to the jump. He was hung up about 1/3-1/2 way up on the wall by his canopy whilst rescue services recovered his body and pronounced dead soon afterwards. Mark had experience with aerials but not from this exit point, it was his second jump from nose 3 that day.
Mark recently proposed to his long term partner, Anna. Which she accepted during AirGamez 2018 event. He also leaves behind twin girls who are three years old. Mark had many friends across the world who will be devastated to hear of his passing.
 
Updated from his partner Anna who wanted to share 9th Feb 2019 
""I had begun to worry that the girls memories of Mark were fading, and what could I do about it. But they were busy being normal 3 year olds and who am I to stop them?
I was wrong.
Of course they were frequently touching on the subject in their games, their teddies would die a lot. I leave them to it or give them hugs and talk about it. I want them to be able to express themselves without fear.
But only just this last week, have they suddenly shown me they have a heart as heavy as any adult.
Bethany has had fierce fierce tantrums then when the storm passes she cries very gently for Daddy. She looked at me one morning and said sweetly that she cries in the night because she misses him.
But as I put them to bed tonight she wept and howled as if with fresh pain. Then Megan’s barriers dropped and she wept too. I carried them both to my bed and we huddled together looking at baby photos to cheer ourselves up.
What a long road it is for my precious girls. And how it hurts not to be able to make things right for them."""

“Bart had a good push and normal start. He flew straight out off the exit for four seconds and then banked to the left in an attempt to split the tree gate formed by the lone tree on the pillar to the left and the wall. It appears that during the turn he lost just a little bit too much speed and altitude which caused him to not clear the pillar by a very narrow margin. These facts were discovered after recovering Bart's Gopro from the hillside below the exit.
Good bye Bart my friend, you are loved by many.”
 
 
 
 
Bart was an experienced Wingsuit Pilot and Wingsuit Base jumper. He had over 1000 BASE jumps and more than 1000 skydives. He had been base jumping for over 10 years. He was considered a responsible jumper and liked by many.
He had just spent a couple of weeks jumping in the Brento-Lake Garda region, before coming to Switzerland. He was in the third or fourth week of a wingsuit Base trip. He was jumping an Aura 3 which he purchased this year.
He arrived at Walenstadt Monday evening, did a total of 6 jumps from Sputnik on Tuesday and Wednesday. Bart had jumped at Walenstadt on previous trips.
Facts: It was Bart’s first jump on fatal attraction.. He had jumped “less than fatal” a few times, which has a similar exit profile (on a previous trip to Walenstadt). He asked to go jump “Fatal Attraction” as he wanted to check it out.
Bart was briefed on the exit, angles, ledges and direction of push. He jumped last in a group of three at approximately 2.15pm. First two jumpers landed in the lz and saw Bart’s canopy flying out super high above the barn. The canopy seemed to be drifting right and went out of view. A Jumper on the Sputnik Exit saw the canopy, pointed it out to another jumper, before they exited and said “watch out for that canopy”.. then the canopy continued drifting right and disappeared into the trees. Bart was jumping an Aura3, CRUX and Hay duke.
I was solo on another exit(high trench). I received info that a Heli had been called to look for Bart after a suspected panic pitch. Helicopter had not left the airport and I was clear to jump. I flew a high line over the last seen location.. saw his canopy on the side of a ridge.. flared, deployed.. top landed.. hiked to him and found him unconscious, unresponsive, not breathing. Significant trauma to the head.. wingsuit fully zipped up.. Helmet and shoe missing.. chest mount go pro snapped.. wingsuit torn open top to bottom - parallel to front zippers, Canopy & pilot chute looked normal and un-damaged. Both toggles still stowed in shallow brakes.
Weather: Several flights were done from Sputnik, High Trench and fatal attraction, and conditions did not seem to be an issue. From the first 2 jumpers, there was lifting air on exit. Some cloud developing. Winds were light at exit, right to left, valley wind could be seen down on the lake and were felt by some jumpers during there flights. No rain that day. Rock on Exit point was dry.
Conclusion: Given the level of trauma I saw on his body, I suspect it was from a high speed impact in the start of his flight. His parachute was likely deployed either just before impact or as a result of impact."

As we gear up we felt crosswinds with a few gusts, down at the exit we couldn’t feel any crosswinds just the rising thermal air as it was a hot day, in Walenstadt about 30 degree Celsius (86 farenheit) up to about 14 degree Celsius (57 farenheit).
Treehouse and I did a 2 way of Fatal Attraction, the same as we have done the day before, I exit first and Treehouse followed me. We exited and as soon as we flew we turned left along to fly along the wall. My start was a bit faster than his as I could see in my rear facing camera. He caught up with me and was about the same altitude than I was, maybe a bit lower. Flying along the wall I could feel the rising air giving me lift but stable. 15 seconds after exit I see Treehouse passing in a safe distance below me to the right, judging from my rear cam he avoided flying over the pillar I flew over as he was a bit lower than I was. Once he passed me I stayed on altitude knowing he will turn right entering the gully we talked about before exiting. As he dove down turning right to enter the gully I followed him. We flew the gully conservative with height and lots of speed. Coming out of the gully we disconnected from the terrain flattened out the angle of attack to bleed of speed and turned right to fly straight back to the LZ, one more gully to fly across till the terrain finally would drop down to the LZ and we would have all the altitude to deploy nice and high. At this point Treehouse was ahead to the right of me. Just before the terrain would drop down I noticed the first twitch in his flight, I didn’t feel or notice any wind or change in condition. Suddenly he dove 45 degree to the left and down, as Treehouse dove he flipped lip on his back and disappeared in the trees back first. I flew another 12 seconds till I was above the LZ to deploy.
Later that day the Police in Walenstadt let me inspect his Wingsuit and the Wingsuit appeared with no prior damage that could have caused the damage, leading edge, zippers, vents, grippers, booties, fines (phoenix fly) everything still intact. A few weeks prior Treehouse has mentioned he had a seizure and that he had those once in a while but doesn’t know what causes them. Speaking to his family they told me that he had those since he was a little boy. It is just a speculation from watching the hole event that he may have had another seizure mid flight.
Treehouse was a well known experienced all round local BASE jumper at the Chief and the community calling Squamish his home. Having always a smile on his face, a funny story in his bag or a hilarious comment to make. His house was open to all the BASE jumper.
We lost a great person, friend, son, brother and uncle of three.
Rest in Peace my friend and fellow jumper you will be missed forever."

Climbers on the wall heard an inflation and immediately noticed the canopy slowly turning back to the wall to impact again and again before coming to rest at bottom.
Please be aware that all information here can change and that this is only what has been told from jumpers who were there on the exit.

He spun himself around 180 and pitched very low. Sylvains canopy extracted but did not fully inflate before impact. It was an exit he had jumped many many times before (over 200). He was very familiar with it. It appeared to have been loss of altitude awarenesses. He was focusing more on turning himself away from the cliff than his altitude. Sylvain loved to pull very low so it's very possible he just misjudged an intentional low pull. We will never know for certain. I do not believe it was a issue of complacency. Sylvain wouldn't let us do the jump during the day because he said it was too windy (even though I thought it was okay to jump). Sylvain appeared to be reckless to some, but he was actually quite calculated and knew when to walk away from a jump. Just the day before his last jump we went to jump a cliff by the sea. It was extremely windy and 3 of us jumped anyway, but Sylvain did not.
Sylvain was my mentor and has taught me so much in BASE and in life. He was someone many of us looked up to. He is a legend. He enjoyed every minute of his life and lived it to the fullest. We will deeply miss him."

Bjørn Emils brother was roughly a meter in front of Bjørn Emil and slightly to his left. 30 meters below, a large ledge ran from left to right, gradually protruding on the right side. The jumpers lept simultaneously with good exits. The left jumper barely cleared the ledge and flew out and deployed as normal. Bjørn Emil never cleared the ledge, impacting after two seconds. 
His canopy came out on impact, inflated and flew out from the wall in a slow right turn, eventually impacting the wall again and putting Bjørn Emil to rest on the cliff. Rescue was called and he was exfiltrated by helicopter.

Updated:16th July
This was Oswaldo’s 20th BASE jump, his 4th jump from exit #6 at Kjerag. His first jump from exit 6 was slick(no tracksuit). His 2nd and 3rd jump were in his tracksuit that he received at the event. He had done some practice jumps in his friend’s tracksuit prior to the event.
He had a normal exit, swept into the tracking position and began to turn to the right, he got almost no forward movement prior to the turn. At 10 seconds, he pitched his pilot chute while facing the wall. He impacted a ledge when he was almost to line stretch. His parachute inflated after his first impact and was slowly rotating. He impacted the wall several more times and came to rest at the top of the talus. It seems from the video that the initial impact was unsurvivable and was announced dead at the scene.
Oswaldo was doing the work. He had taken the first jump course and an advanced BASE course the previous year. His dream was to jump a wingsuit from Kjerag and was working towards that goal. His previous jumps were good, but did have a tendency to turn once he was up to speed. There is nothing that can simulate subterminal tracking other than subterminal tracking. You can’t skydive your tracksuit enough, but the exit is already in high airspeed and the squishy air of subterminal is a completely different beast. Balloon jumps are always recommended prior to terminal walls, if you have one available to you."
Alexander Sonnenberg,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,38,2018-06-20,5,2000,,300,,France,BASE Fatality,Earth,Impact in terminal freefall,"Aura 3, Expert Wingsuit by Squirrel","Ibex, 7 Cell - Vented by Squirrel","Stream, 2 Pin by Squirrel","Slider Up, BOC, BOC",Winds light and variable,"Loss of speed-glide, Proximity flying","Alex and I arrived at the exit for Leschaux at 1930 in the haute-savoie region of France about an hour South West of Geneva. We had jumped the exit the evening prior and had good flights with good conditions, we planned to fly the same line again. Conditions seemed optimal and the hike is short, about an hour so we both felt physically fresh. We took our time gearing up and talked over what line we would fly. It was decided that we would fly through the tree gate which is located on piece of terrain well below the exit and roughly 600 meters horizontally from the exit. Usually you must dive with considerable force to be able to split the gate, which is substantial in size, about 30ft across. Alex asked if I could shoot outside video and I said yes.
We talked over which directions we would push and readied ourselves to exit. Alex gave the count and our exit went smoothly. I was immediately positioned about 40ft above and to the left of Alex and was planning to fly over the terrain and trees viewing him mostly from the overhead vantage. I wanted to remain higher on his left as the terrain to be flown over is a fairly thin ridge which juts out from right to left and slopes down from the right with the most viable out being to the left, affording you more altitude over terrain the farther left you go. As soon as Alex started flying (3 Seconds) he was not pointed directly at the gate, instead flying at a slight oblique angle to the left of it. Within a few seconds of flying I made the assumption that he did not like his sight picture and was opting to go completely around the terrain feature, as it is by no means a mandatory obstacle if you choose early enough to detour around it to the left. I held my position but noticed Alex’s head turned to the right looking at the gate. At this point though (8 seconds), I no longer felt we could safely divert from our flight path safely and believed that Alex was thinking the same thing when he suddenly banked hard to the right and again to the left in order to set up on the gate. The turns caused him to lose speed and altitude and our gap was now one hundred feet or more with me slightly ahead of and above him. As I watched I could easily tell that he was flying at a higher and higher AoA by the second. A few seconds out from the gate I could see that he had reached a critical AoA and a moment later I saw that the suit was stalling and his glide decreased drastically. At this point he would have been very hard pressed to execute a turn to the left towards the out. As I watched, Alex entered into a stall and veered left, causing him to impact a tree on the left side of the gate. As I flew around the terrain I witnessed him exiting the tree without his helmet and impacting the grass on the steep slope behind it. He slid on his back until the terrain cliffed out and he fell another several hundred feet into the forest below. I was in shock and kept my eyes on him until he impacted a second time, hoping to see him pitch. He did not and I momentarily came to the realization that I had slowed considerably while watching him and so went to the task of getting my speed and GR back as the second half of the jump does not have a large margin over terrain while transporting back to the LZ.
After landing I contacted the PGHM, they responded immediately and were on scene within the hour, recovering Alex before nightfall.
Alex Sonnenberg was a good friend, he touched many people in his 38 years, was an amazing person and an American Hero. He is survived by his Wife Amina, his parents, sister and brothers. He will be sorely missed.
Lessons learned:
1.)If you cannot attack terrain confidently and with speed, abort immediately and seek altitude. There is no room for emotion or ego in this decision matrix. Physics is too fair.
2.) Don’t get caught in the moment. As Miyamoto Musashi writes in his book “The five rings”. You must meditate and mentally rehearse your immediate actions and prefabricate thought processes to fall back on in the wake of witnessing something like this. Had the line been more challenging, my disengagement from what I was doing for those several seconds could have killed me as well. Once I saw Alex impact the tree and slide over the edge I should have been immediately back to the task of flying.
3.) Plan your dive, dive your plan. I don’t know why Alex decided to fly at the oblique angle if he intended to go for the gates.
4.) Be able to communicate. Learn phrases in the language of the land you are jumping in. I was lucky to be able to speak enough French to ask for help and ensure that the helicopter rescue was able to locate Alex before nightfall. Have phrases written and laminated and have the appropriate rescue numbers in your cell phone AND on the laminated card. Phones die or are sometimes broken or have no service. You may have to seek a landline in a remote area or village. Have a device that can get you coordinates to relay to rescuers. A sat beacon is always a good idea as well. If you have the excuse that you cannot afford a burner phone or international service for your vacation, you should rethink BASE.
5.) You're not alone in this game of BASE. We BASE jump for ourselves. It is a wholly selfish act. The very least we can do is to pack our parachutes diligently for our Mothers. Take our time and pick a safe line for our Fathers. Assess the conditions and walk off if necessary for our Brothers and Sisters. And fly with a margin of error for the friends we jump with to keep them from the horror and pain of witnessing our demise. As Douggs would say “Who’s the best BASE jumper in the world? The one having the most fun!” Take it slow.
I am guilty of violating all of these suggestions I just put forth….but I wish I hadn’t and will do my best never to again.
Alex, I love you brother. Thank you for everything. Until that day."

Super stable exit, but does not really get the track going, so she did not come over the island in the middle of katthammaren she went between the ledge on the right and the island and impacted in between.
My guess is that her visuals were at the landing and that she did not see the ledge coming.
Makes emergency pull, has about 2 sec under canopy (180 opening) before impact.

Sylvain was in slick as well and jumped a few seconds after myself and opened with no problems.
Jeremia jumped in a Phoenix fly tracking suit (PTS) but as soon as he exited he clipped the underhung section with his legs and this sent him into a violent spin
he was unstable and pulled but it was too late he impacted with the slider still inside the canopy. Sylvain and myself landed and raced up to where he had rested in the forest
on the talus but he was dead when we arrived.
Jeremia was the life of the party he was well known by most of the French community and always full of energy and always in a good mood he was a very rounded jumper

Oscar was loved by many and I feel privileged to have been his friend. He was an exceptional person, warm hearted, caring, humble, generous, and a teacher of life to many of us. Also an incredibly strong climber, strong in the mountains, and was among the elite in the Spanish mountain rescue police (Guardia Civil - Unidad Especial del Grupo de Rescate de Montaña).
Oscar's approach to jumping was a steady and conservative progression, always putting in the groundwork. He was quietly determined and did not push hard. Oscar was one of the safest jumpers I knew.
He was motivated to fly wingsuits and this year to fly terrain. That he signed on for a Next Level course earlier in the year is testament to his methodical and cautious progression. I was his mentor for wingsuit BASE.
In 2017, Oscar and I opened the jump 'Punta Calva'. At that time he was not ready for terrain flying, but I discovered that this jump has good proximity lines. The exit is not too technical, you then traverse to the left for about 20 seconds over steep terrain, and then make a turn to the right and dive down on the talus. The talus in that part of the mountain is generally steeper than 2:1 with no serious terrain traps. In my opinion its a good jump to start practicing proximity flying, because one can easily disconnect anywhere from the terrain. Last year Oscar made something like 10 to 15 jumps from this exit flying high (no proximity).
This year, Oscar was motivated to start terrain flying. Punta Calva was the obvious choice. He made several flights over what is probably the most straightforward proximity line on the mountain, each flight progressively lower. Oscar was flying with good speed always, and had good control of his suit. He could sustain a glide of more than 3:1 at speed when necessary.
On the day of his accident, we made a jump on Punta Calva in the morning. He followed his normal line, with good speed and stayed more connected with the terrain than previously. It was his best proximity flight and he was super excited about it. We went through his video twice and I was stoked for him. It looked good to me, he flew a tighter line than before, but it wasn't too close and he was fast and in control.
We packed and rested and then decided to go for an evening jump, after a thunderstorm. Its a 2 hour hike, but we both felt physically fine at the exit, no fatigue, no stress. It was a little cold and a light breeze less than 5km/hr. The air was clear apart from some small clouds at the very end of the traverse section of the flight where we normally turn right and start diving. In other words, the conditions were perfect for a high flight straight out to the landing, but less than perfect for flying the proximity line. The plan was for Oscar to jump first, and then me once he had landed. After 15 minutes waiting, the clouds were still there on the talus and Oscar offered for me to go first if I wanted. I was getting cold and the clouds didn't bother me too much so I agreed, and jumped.
I flew my line, the clouds were thin and did not get in my way. I felt no significant turbulence. My flight over the talus took me to a different landing field than the one that Oscar was using. 10 minutes after I landed those small clouds were still there on the talus, and half an hour later they were gone.
We called the rescue 1 hour after I landed, after trying to reach Oscar on his phone and checking his landing area.
We don't know when Oscar jumped and at this stage we don't have his camera or Flysight. It appears that he impacted some tall trees on a small ridge / shoulder towards the end of the traverse section of the flight, and came to rest 100 metres further on. His canopy was out, slider up, brakes stowed... probably out due to impact. He died instantly.
Its not clear to us why he crashed there, because there is an easy escape to the right. Possible factors are...
1. Having a bad start or poor glide and being lower there than he was expecting, but still trying to follow the line that he aced in the morning.
2. Clouds.
3. Some other misjudgement.
In hindsight there are so many things I wish I had said. Would they have made a difference, maybe yes maybe no. I want to go back to that morning jump and say, ""Wow Oscar that looked really good. Now don't get too excited, take a step back, be safer, fly higher."" I accept that I had a motivating influence on Oscar's flying and I feel terrible for it.
Buen vuelo amigo, siempre.
David.
UPDATE
We found Oscar's GoPro and Flysight. It appears he did not turn on his Flysight for this jump. From his video, we see a normal start, then slower than normal flight. His impact is 21 seconds into the flight into the top of 3 tall pine trees growing on a small shoulder of a cliff. He could have flown safely to the right of the trees if he wanted. He tumbled 30 to 50 metres to the base of the cliff. Clouds were not a factor.
Oscar was flying the same line as his morning jump but lower and slower. He was 19 seconds to reach the same trees in the morning. My opinion is that he was flying too slowly and without energy. He seemed to be lining up to buzz those trees from a long way back (at least the last 10 seconds of his flight), and then in the last second he lost his flight, was unable to 'pop' over the trees, and too late to turn right.
I believe Oscar was so focussed on trying to repeat his morning jump that he didn't pay attention to how this flight was going differently.
What can we learn (nothing new really)...
1. Always fly with speed and energy when close to the ground. If you can't, then go for plan B.
2. Don't aim to fly over something. If you want to buzz something you need to be coming down like an eagle in full attack, not just flying lazily towards it.
3. Don't be so focussed on flying the line that you lose your awareness.
The sad thing is that Oscar knew all this before his last jump."

Eddie was doing a static line from a 150 foot antenna. He had a three foot sling looped through the hip ring on his harness, one on each side. He used these periodically when he needed to clip in to a tower for various reasons. He was using a non-locking carabiner on each sling.
Eddie’s harness had factory saddlebags sewn onto the back of each leg strap. Prior to exit, he would tuck the excess webbing into the opening between his lag padding and the bottom skin of the saddlebag and then tuck the carabiner into the opening as well.
In the video, it shows Eddie climbing over the railing and sitting on the top rail. His slings were already stowed prior to recording and his yellow fluorescent bridle is clearly visible and free of any miss routing or potential snags. The video shows him handling the bridle with his right hand as if he is checking the routing of the bridle and he places the sewn in magnet on his bridle on his right hip ring.
Prior to his jump, the video shows very briefly that the carabiner on his right side, probably due to climbing and sitting, had worked its way out about half way. When he jumps out, the bridle is laying over the gate of the carabiner and when the bridle is held tight by the brake cord the tension forced the gate of the carabiner open and the bridle became clipped in.
The brake cord held, the pins were pulled and the canopy was free to be extracted. By this time, it looks as if the excess webbing of the sling had come out of the pocket placing the carabiner and bridle more towards his back. The canopy was being pulled through the carabiner and stopped about two feet into it. At this point Eddie is turned onto his left side, the brake cord brakes and he continues his rotation into his back. The pilot chute is clearly doing its job. At one point in the video, the canopy can be seen being choked off by the carabiner, which is attached to his harness, the bridle is at full stretch and the pilot chute is in tow until impact. Eddie was found with the sling gripped firmly in his hand. It appears he was trying to clear it but didn’t have enough altitude. He died on impact."

Nice and stable exit , with a good flight that lasted 33 seconds before he started his pulling sequence. He tried to pull for 5,6 seconds before he went out for a full flight again and then trying to stall his suit to decrease speed before impact. After 2-3 sec Kristian tried to the very end and rolled to his side to give that last try to survive the impact.
The indications of this accident is due to the cold weather. Kristian had cold fingers/hands on the exit.
He was without gloves for at least 12 minutes before the jump. He put thin gloves on 5 minutes before the exit that is good for grip and terrible in the cold. He tried to blow his hands warm before exit.
Its truly believed that the cold made him loose the feelings in his fingers and hands.
Kristian crashed with a no pull.

Fly sight data shows that jumpers have flown this line previously with higher speed at the same Glide Ratio (GR). Previous flights had been flown in south winds with sunshine on the terrain.
Flightplan: The plan was to fly the high left line which included a flat no pull zone with no out to the right 41 seconds after exit. A discussion was had about the northerly head wind and that if the terrain was not flyable the plan was to make the decision early to peel out to the right before entering the no pull/no out section of the flight.
Flight:
Ben had a steeper than usual exit. Ben's wingsuit inflates and begins flying at the 4.5 second mark after exit, followed by a straight flight for 3 seconds before initiating the left turn toward the high left ridge.
Jumper 2's wingsuit begins flying 3 seconds after exit and he immediately banks left toward the high ridge and overtakes Ben in flight.
It can be seen that Ben is lower, further right and slightly behind Jumper 2 during the flight. Ben comes into view of Jumper 2's Chest Camera and can been seen flying at a higher GR gaining altitude to make it over the ridge. As seen from flysight data Jumper 2 is at this stage flying at a high GR to make it over the same ridge. Rear Cam footage from Jumper 2 shows Ben flying at a high GR to fly over the ridge, he can be seen gaining altitude and flying behind and above to the left of Jumper 2 who's glide ratio at that exact moment was at 3.2 with a total speed of 152km/h. It was during this maneuver that Ben flew through the burble created by Jumper 2's wingsuit. At this moment Ben became unstable in flight and looses more groundspeed and can be seen to be trying to fly through it, he regains control of his wingsuit however this has dramatically decreased his groundspeed. Moments later the groundspeed eventually becomes too low and his wingsuit stalls and turns left and down into the trees, Ben impacted the terrain without deploying a parachute 47 seconds after exiting.
Speculative: In terms of factual evidence It is unknown weather the burble is the root cause of the accident or a causal factor. With Ben's already high GR and lower groundspeed it is hard to say whether or not he would have made it over the ridge had he not flown through a burble.
Previous wingsuit BASE flights Ben has done this season witnessed by people he has jumped with and by flysight data shows that Ben has consistently flown his SU 2 with high speed and energy converting this into a solid flare before a stable deployment. He was a competent and current BASE Jumper who understood the required flight characteristics for wingsuit BASE.
Conclusion:
While flying flat terrain in a multi-way formation it is critical to be aware of the lead flyer's burble, your groundspeed and glide ratio and a decision to commit to the line instead of taking the 'out' before its too late.
Paganella is considered by most as a safe exit for experienced pilots. Please be aware when flying the high left line that there is a flat section with no out to the right if you are low over the terrain. Suit selection, weather / wind conditions and multiway flying all need to be considered and discussed before flying this line."

Luis Alonso,SPAIN,55,2017-07-16,4,,,200,,Spain,BASE Fatality,Earth,Object strike under canopy,"Slick, Slick by Everyday Clothing worn","Troll, 7 Cell - Vented by Atair Aerodynamics",Unknown,"Slider Up, BOC, BOC",Sunny,180 Offheading,"It was a perfect day, sunny and a slight breeze from the North (tailwind).
We arrived 7 jumpers to the exit, the idea was to jump and land in the water in the reservoir while cutting away. We had a support boat in the water.
The day before we were jumping in Benasque and Ager and all was going great. Luis had also just returned from a trip in LAuterbrunnen having done loads of jumps there and he was very current with tracking.
The Pared de Aragon is 450m to impact. For the first 3/4 seconds the cliff is near vertical, and then it's super overhung.
Normally we take between 8 and 11 seconds, though in this occasion since we were wearing shorts 8 to 9 seconds was perfect. Rig was packed slider up.
We got jumping one by one and everything was running perfect and according to plan. Drop in the water, retrieve the canopy, and onto the shore.
Luis exited last, it was his first jump from this cliff.
Watching from below, it looked like he had a good exit and then, possibly when transitioning to a tracking position, he was seen to become unstable and he pitched around the 3/4 second mark leading to a very violent off heading of about 140 while still in the vertical section of the cliff.
It seemed he attempted to turn it around, but due to the proximity of the wall and the speed with which the canopy surged he impacted hard on his side on top of a ledge.
He was not seen to be moving or attempting to regain control after the initial impact. The canopy remained pressurized, facing the wall, and Luis was deposited at the base of the cliff taking some further impacts along the way.
There was nothing it could be done for him, the first impact was fatal.
A very unlucky incident... If it had happened a bit lower it would have been a non-event. 180's in this wall are generally not a problem to turn them around as you are well away from the cliff with loads of space.
Notes: While we will never know what made Luis become unstable and the reasons why he took the decision to pitch at between 3 and 4 seconds, we think is important to remind of the importance to carefully consider each jump we do, its characteristics and variables, before each and every jump and be confident as much as we can that we can react to any eventualities accordingly to that assesement.
There is 2 main factors that contributed to Luis having the offheading, and a 3rd factor that contributed to him striking the wall.
- Pitching while unstable, has never been great for heading performance.
- Deploying a slider-up packjob prepared for a 9 second delay after 3/4 seconds is known to lead to heading issues and twists, the shallow break setting may cause the canopy to surge on opening, the speed at which it'll fly towards the cliff will be faster, and the delay in inflation and slider having to descend means early inputs to correct heading will have little to no effect.
- Pulling while still at the vertical section of the cliff takes away some margin that could be had if deploying lower at the overhung section, and this ties with the points above.
Given this cliff allows you to pull at around 9 seconds at which point you have maximum separation from the wall, giving it some more time could possibly have allowed to assume a controlled symetrical position for deploying, the airspeed would be the one the rig was packed to deploy at lowering the chance of deployment issues, and if still having to deal with heading problems the extra separation would surely be most apreciated.
Luis was aware of this, and the reason he pulled high will remain a mystery, but the lessons on adapting our 'EPs' for each individual jump should be heeded.
He leaves behind a beautiful family and a much bigger family of friends all around the World. He was well known in the Spanish climbing scene as a pioneer of ice/mixed climbing during the 1990's and being a handy Alpinist and crack climber, when he was referred to as ""el maestro"", but his humble demeanour meant it would cost you a few rounds of beers and some prodding before he even mentioned that he goes climbing when not jumping and that he's done ""a few things here and there"". And that's how Luis was. Humble, friendly, approachable, gentle, a pleasure to be around with, with a heart of gold and a passion to match, attributes which quickly made him a reference within the Spanish base jumping community.
Cliche as it may sound, it is truer than ever that the World is a poorer place without him.
Be careful out there everyone!"

David's flight was slow, he passed the ridge lower than expected and flew quite low over the plateau. At this point jumper #2 was higher and in front of David. Shortly after, jumper #3 had previously breaked and dived hard to stay close to David, detached a little and decided to pull and landed safely on the plateau.
Jumper #2 stayed high and flew the end of the line as planned. David had then a few opportunities to perform an emergency low pull but decided to try to pass the plateau.

Civietta on this day
(05.07.17). The meteorological conditions were good with a light wind
from the left (south to north), same like at the jump before.
Several lines are possible to fly from the exit point to the landing
area. A direct flight path would be easy, others are more challenging
to the left sector.
As he was the last jumper out of a group of 9 wingsuiters, nobody was
able to witness his final jump. After he didn’t show up in the landing area, nor called, search and rescue was informed
Later he was found approximately 2km in front of the exit point on a
rather left flight path line. He must have striked a ridge with trees
in freefall/full flight and he come to rest in the gulch behind. It is
confirmed that there was no attempt to pull and he must have died
instantly.
Despite the tragic, it might just have been a terrible error in judgment.
Thoughts for relevance:
He used a suit which he had only jumped 10-12 times (not that critical at this spot if you choose the right line). Also, he was wearing a selfie stick camera mount on his helmet
which may disturbed his vision and depth perception. Plus he did his
second flight that day from almost the same spot and might have been pushing it to fly further over the hill in front of him.

Me in front leading the way, Micah wanted to follow me and Mathias as number three.
Micah exited on the inner so he could be on me from the beginning.
We had good starts turning right to enter behind the spires and into the huge couloir. I saw Micah´s shadow when we where flying through in a quite hard dive and lots of energy. That part of the flight was amazing. Beautiful, fast, powerful and safe in the same time.
When we disconnected and flew out in the valley I saw Micah on my right side flying out in safe environment to pull. We had pretty good height when we flew out in the valley. When I saw his video I saw him flare and have lots of altitude. At this point myself was still continuing flying much lower than Micah.
I pulled my canopy and right after opening i saw Micah still on my right side continuing flying. I was quite shocked that he hadn`t pulled because he started to be low.
Then i saw him struggling to pull his PC. I saw he tried different moves. I'm not 100% but i saw him de-arch instead of arching. Then he turned over to his back just before the impact.
He was fighting to the very end to find the PC, he was not interested at all to crash himself into the ground. The eyewitnesses heard him scream before impact.
I landed and called rescue and ran over to find Micah. There was several people from the neighbourhood there already. There was nothing we could do.
When police and ambulance came we checked Micah`s rig. Pilot chute was just out of the pocket, bridle still in folds. So the pilot chute came out of the BOC on impact.
We checked pins and they were moving, just to be 100% sure.
We could not check his WS at this moment, but I think this issue has been taken from other jumpers and the manufacturer.
This accident was one of the accidents that just should not happen. I look back at the jump and can`t find any other things we could do to avoid this. The jump is one of the safer jumps I do. The flight pattern was done in a proper way.
I hope we can learn from this as with all the other accidents. The pull is the moment when I have highest heart beats through a jump. Be sure that you can pull whatever you fly.
I'm really sad for the loss to all of you.

The ridge as you fly along gets flatter and flatter and at the end it's around a 3.5 glide ratio, one side of the ridge is east and one is west.
It seems that at the end of the ridge he did not have enough speed and height and when he decided to turn to the landing zone he may have caught some cooler descending air and he lost his flight characteristics very quick .
He knew that it was a full glide flight above the ridge because he had told me this prior to jumping, it's never a good idea to proximity fly without some speed in reserve. At that very moment when he turned he might have realised it was too late and even he knew to reserve some speed.
He was never taking too much risk usually on his flights but he made a wrong choice as it can happen to many of us at any time. He just did not leave enough safety margin
You lose reality of danger when you live your dreams, flying above the mountains we are always fragile
Parachute was found open at line stretch, slider up and front cells still folded suggesting the gear was opened on impact or a very low emergency low pull.
The jump was a two way they exited and flew the left line which is a highly advanced and technical line to be flying putting you at full glide and proximity flying the flight. He was found impacted shortly after.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 31st may
Here is the update to this incident: According to the official police report, and EMT accounts, the jumper opened his canopy, then for some reason had a cliff strike.
He then rested on the talus, where EMT's found him.
NOTE: I just talked to the investigator about this incident, and this is what I have been told:
The witness in the boat charter that saw the incident stated the jumper waved at the boat, then backed up, and then jumped.
About 2/3rds the way down, for some unknown reason, the canopy flew back into the cliff. He struck the cliff several times before landing upon the talus.
The EMT's arrived to the jumper and he was still alive but sustained severe trauma to his lower extremities. It was assumed both legs were fractured, and possibly his pelvis. CPR was performed for about 20-minutes, before the jumper was pronounced dead.
* From the EMT report, it is likely that a pelvis and/or a femur break could have been a leading cause of internal bleeding.
[B]*** One thing is for sure; everyone should understand the importance of proper off-heading emergency procedures. ***[/B]
I have seen many videos on YT & FB showing jumpers using toggles to turn a canopy, and the video shows the jumper striking the object.

At this point Uli swept his arm wings probably in an attempt to dive down to the base but without success.
He then slid left approximately 10m and initiated a radical 90 degree right turn towards the base. He immediately began to straighten his trajectory to be parallel with the base but appeared to misjudge his closing speed.
The base saw Uli arriving from their left at high speed and the base flared to try to avoid the collision.
Uli passed under the base on head level and there was light contact between the jumpers left feet. As Uli passed under the base he closed his right arm wing and bent his right leg, probably in preparation for the collision, which in the end was mild.
Uli's body position put the suit in to a hard diving right turn directly towards the wall, he struggled to regain control of the suit in a near vertical position but impacted the wall a few seconds later.
In the previous jumps Uli had commented on having difficulty diving down to the base and how he often used an 'S' turn to lose altitude.
The base was flying a smaller class suit (Scorpion) compared to Uli (Jedei 3) which likely contributed to the level issues.
Uli had around 60 BASE jumps on the suit in question, over 2000 BASE jumps total and was current.
He was regarded as one of the best wingsuit pilots in the world, opening some of the most technical short start exits to date as well as flying through a 3m metal ring and a 2m cave. Whilst we can never be 100% sure of Uli's intention it would seem he chose a non-standard technique to lose altitude and executed the maneuver too aggressively."

He had been recently training mostly with his wingsuit but saying he was not current at tracking anymore would be largely implausible. This jump is a modern very positive ""one piece tracking"" one, lacking any sort of margin for human or environmental suboptimal parameters.
Lolo was an extremely talented jumper as well as a bright minded enthusiast, thinking out of the box and coming out with innovative design concepts. His uncommon approach lead him to build his own tracksuits dubbed the ""Lolo Suits"". He inspired many and showed the community what what possible to achieve through the concept of single piece tracking suits (onesies). Recognized as one of the best trackers out there he achieved many lines that were before believed to be specific to wingsuits only, and notably tracked the Brévent exit in summer 2015 with his friend Veush"

The conditions in which she exited from Croix des Têtes in France were calm and peaceful. The hiking approach took a little over 2 hours accompanied by a large group of local jumpers and a few intimate friends. The moving pace was both relaxed and joyful since there was a dense cloud layer which obstructed a clear view of the landing areas below. There was no rush to arrive at the summit until weather conditions improved... Upon arriving at the exit point the groups energy became excited as the clouds parted, allowing for a majestic reveal of the stunning mountainscape around us and the entire flight path to the landing areas.
The group exited the cliff at a relaxed pace while Kat, julie and myself intentionally waited to be the last jumpers. We wanted to fully enjoy the peaceful setting of being on a mountain alone. I had carried two radios with me on the hike to communicate with our group and in case of an emergency. It was decided that I would jump first, Julie second and Katlast, as she insisted she wanted to go last. I exited from the mountain, had a smooth tracking flight and windless landing. Shortly thereafter, I radioed up to Julie and Kat that the conditions were ideal, the wind was very calm and my landing pattern was from right to left at the tracker landing location. The batteries in Kat's radio died shortly after my last communication of conditions (of which I was not aware) and I saw Julie exit from the cliff with a good flight and safe canopy opening.
Approximately 30 seconds after Julie exited, I witnessed Kat push off the cliff cleanly and into a steep track. I was able to clearly watch her body fly for about 7-8 seconds before it disappeared behind a ridge line that concealed a section of the jump. From my perspective, Kat appeared to be flying in a steep trajectory away from the vertical section of wall. I waited to see her emerge around a second notch in the terrain, either still tracking or under canopy depending on her flight decisions. After waiting a couple of minutes I didnt see any evidence that she had cleared the second notch and I began trying to contact her on the radio. With no response after 5 minutes I immediately ran down to where Julie had landed and we attempted to reach Kat twice on her cell phone, leaving messages and updates to our actions and concerns. It was assumed she had either pulled low and was up on the talus, unable to communicate effectively or both devices had been lost or damaged somehow. At that point we called a rescue helicopter to assess the situation from an aerial perspective.
To the best of our knowledge it appears that Kat impacted the top of the first of two notches that a tracker must out fly while tracking Croix des Têtes. After examining her gear and the resting spot of her body we suspect that she died on impact without deploying a parachute or pilot chute. There seems little reason to think there was any case of bridle wrap. Both toggles were still found in the stowed position and the slider remained up. Three of her lines had been broken near the connection point to the canopy, likely from snagging on a tree or cliff edge on the top of the notch. Her initial impact is most likely what caused the parachute to come loose from the container. Based on evidence of minor tears in her track suit, grass and mud stains found on her gear (on both the interior and exterior of her container) we assume she committed to a low flight pattern and attempted to out track the first notch, but was unsuccessful in doing so. Her body then fell to its resting place at the base of the notch/waterfall with her canopy draped over her body. Due to the visibly steep angle of her track and the proximity of the notch where she impacted, she collided at high speed, suggesting no prolonged suffering. Further evidence supports this as her helmet was not found on her head, or anywhere near the body."

Brevent - Chamonix, France
Weather was pretty much ideal. Sunny,
no clouds, 30C, slight breeze on exit, but nothing significant. Dave was jumping a Freak.At 16:15 on Sunday, Jumper was doing his fourth jump of the day on Brevent.
His previous three jumps that day had all been solos in line 3, where he started off doing a high pass, and was gradually working on feeling out the line,
familiarizing himself with the terrain, and getting slightly lower in it. On this jump, a second jumper was following him.
Dave exits first, nothing unusual, and the second jumper follows about a half second behind.
The second jumper cuts the corner around the pillar and catches up to him quickly,
hits the brakes a little too hard and looses the speed necessary to stay on Jumper's glide ratio.
The second jumper turns slightly left to go for a lower point on the ridge.
Dave maintains his intended flight path, aiming to cross the ridge at the highest point of line 3, as he had done on his previous three jumps.
He is slightly lower on this jump though and he does not have the necessary speed to make the ridge.
He sinks out and impacts as he's crossing the ridge, nothing out.
Dave survives with no major bodily injuries, but severe brain trauma.
He is flown, unconscious, to the hospital in Annecy where he is officially pronounced brain dead at 17:30 the next evening.
On Tuesday morning he is operated on for organ donation. His organs saved six lives.
Being a late afternoon/early evening jump, there was less lift than on the previous jumps of the day.
On his previous jumps, Dave had been 10-15 meters above the same point on the ridge. The highest possible entrance point to line 3 is very committing though, as the ridge is flat at that point.
If you realize too late that you're not going to make it, you can't just bail and cross the ridge at a lower point,
you would have to make a sharp 90-110 degree turn to the left.
And if you're already sinking out, that kind of a turn would likely be difficult or impossible to achieve without sliding or dropping into the terrain.
The biggest lessons to take away:
1.Don't fly committing lines in the afternoon. There is less lift and it's more turbulent.
2.Never operate in the highest margins of your own ability.
3.Just because you've made a particular ridge or point on previous jump, dont assume that you will make it again.
4.Speed is everything. Don't ever lose focus on your speed trying to get a certain amount of glide."

Details still unclear as far as timing.
It started raining hard at 11:15 am for 3-4 hours. Another group that included myself,
hiked out from a great base jump with great weather minimal winds earlier that morning.
The winds remained calm most of the day under 5mph at most.
The jumper who previously completed a solo jump that day on a new exit decided to
hike again to a Jump that had been completed before by two jumpers a few years back,
one who vowed he would never jump it again and one who later went missing a few mountains away.
The reason for the difficulty is a downhill exit requiring many steps with a small ledge at 300'
which the previous jumpers missed by inches their first and only jump. It appears that the jumper
did not clear the ledge and at this point that is all that matters.
Lessons Learned:
1./ Carry a Spot Beacon Transmitter at all times to avoid a 3 day Search by your loved ones.
If you jump with in the Alberta Mountain Area this will be a pre-requisite for all jumpers
who want to choose to jump this area. The Park officials have made this Fairly Clear to us in
this search and the one prior which lasted a month and is still unresolved.
2./ Even if you are sure you can do it alone, maybe text a friend and
tell them your intended jump and flight Path.
3./ If a jump is super sketchy ... maybe think about what you want out of your life
and the people's lives you touch. Base jumping is supposed to be fun, it is possible be
done safely and with longevity if you make choices that make sense.
There are a few older jumpers that show that you can enjoy a longer career."

This was a Slider down jump, hand held with 46"" pilot chute.

Jimmy was highly experienced skydiver, 3500+, tandem and AFF, but only around 100 WS, almost all P3.
Jimmy put only 2 skydives on the V3 before taking it to the mountain.
In previous days he did 12 BASE jumps, 11 from Brento, one yesterday from Casale, but straight out from exit.
Many of his Brento jumps were not very good, rather unsteady.
However two steady straight out jumps yesterday, one Brento and one Casale, gave him confidence....
Today he chose to exit and turn round to the left, taking him over the most flown line over some ridges, to then turn 180 right toward main landing in soccer field where other jumpers were waiting.
Jimmy exited well, but shortly after making a gentle left turn he began to try to plane the suit out to stay above the terrain, rather than turning out towards safer ground.
Jimmy pulled the suit progressively shallower, over a period of 10-15 seconds, until severe lateral instability set in and he was dropping out. He kept it flying this way for a bit longer, and then realized too late he was in deep shit.
Jimmy pitched but impacted the last of the ridges before inflated canopy, dying on impact.
As he had option of going straight, and using alternative landing, other jumpers waited for him at soccer field as planned, after some time passed and he was unreachable by phone they went to alternative landing and called rescue after seeing no sign of him (approx. 90 mins after jump).
Rescue located jumper quickly but he was dead at scene.

On the cable car ride up to Brevent, JVH and another jumper decided to do a two way, JVH would follow in whichever line the other jumper wanted to fly. The other jumper proposed the rockstar line, which JVH had followed him on once previously. They then discussed exit positions and angles, and flight procedures for when someone is camera flying"". (Jumper on the left jumps first, pushes more perpendicular to the rock, takes the turn around the pilar wide, and flies at 70-80% in the transition before turning it on and entering the line. Jumper on the right exits second, and pushes parallel to or at slightly more of an angle than the first jumper, then cuts the corner so as to catch up to the first jumper as quickly as possible.) JVH expressed that he would not be following closely behind though, instead he would give a couple seconds and follow loosely to just observe the other jumper flying the line. On previous multi-ways on Brevent, JVH had given at least 1-2 seconds before following off, and would not fly aggressively, usually staying above the treetops.
At the top, as they were gearing up, since JVH didnt want to follow closely anyway, the other jumper asked which side he preferred to exit from. JVH chose the right, so the other jumper took the left. The other jumper then proposed that since John didnt need to catch up to him, he would exit off and fly the line as he usually would without a camera flyer, and John agreed. Although on the way up they had discussed exit angles from these positions when the jumper on the right is flying camera, there was no further discussion at the exit regarding exit angles.
The first jumper makes his countdown and pushes off with nothing out of the ordinary. JVH jumps approximately 1.5 seconds after, and basically pushes to the same axis as the first jumper. About 4 seconds into his jump he hits the first jumper's burble. There is some shaking and a clear loss of power, and he swerves slightly left by about 10 degrees. John makes two grunts, likely realizing that he is in trouble. At a pitch (AoA) nose up he turns very quickly right, about 90 degrees, and decides to try to fly it out. Shortly after his pitch and direction change, at around 7-8 seconds, we hear what sounds like leg wing flapping. He doesnt advance more than 120m horizontally from the point where he turned, and impacts 10 seconds into his jump in the snow in the bottom of the couloir."

Please see an update from someone who was there and witnessed it 
 
Gary Kremer passed away on June 26, 2016.  I wrote the BFL incident report as I was the only eye witness to the entire jump from exit to impact.  At the time I only included the information from Gary’s exit to impact.  
Today is May 21, 2022.  I recently listened to the Exit Point Podcast episode hosted by Matt Blank and Laurent Frat with guest Brad “Patto” Patfield.  As most know, Brad maintains the BFL.  During the interview a discussion regarding outside factors that may contribute to an incident (example, partying the night before,  landing jet lagged and not resting before the first jump on a trip, etc).  For years I have held what I thought to be my opinions vs the simple facts to myself.  After much thought I have decided to add all context leading up to the incident, with the intention of educating either the jumper who finds themselves in Gary’s shoes, or a jumper who finds themselves in my shoes.
I recently moved to Seattle, Washington from Washington DC.  The idea of being able to do legal wingsuit base jumps near where I live was so extraordinary to me at the time I was only focused on me, not those I was jumping with.  I say this because it is a part of how I ended up at the Chief with Gary.  
I had met Gary only in passing before I moved to Seattle.  He was one of the first jumpers in the area I became friends with.  Shortly after I moved Gary asked if I wanted to do a weekend road trip to Canada to do some wingsuit jumps off the Chief.  I was 100 percent in, the excitement was high.  All I knew about Gary’s wingsuit experience was that his FB profile was a picture of him exiting Mount Baring in an Aura.  My excitement stopped me from asking or thinking about what Gary's experience actually was.  I was only thinking about myself and getting to do wingsuit base locally and knowing a new exit point location.    
For those who knew Gary he was a jokester.  On the drive to the Chief I was inquiring to understand as much information about the jump.  Gary told me over and over that it was basically like Brento. I pushed for the jokes to end and he just reiterated that it was like Brento, a gigantic wall with a straight out easy flight.  I knew this wasn't correct and I got the correct information from another friend via text.  I stated this to Gary and he said that was wrong and it was similar to Brento.  To this date I look back and think that Gary might have been serious, and I do not know if he had ever been to Brento.  Gary also stated that when we returned he was going to immediately book a trip to France to jump Brevant.  
The next day we met a couple locals and hiked to the exit.  I did a two way with an experienced local, Gary exited last.  The other jumper and I waited and Gary never landed.  We hiked back to the parking lot and found that Gary had landed on the shoulder of the highway.  This concerned me.  I have attached a video of another jump I did at the chief for a visual of the jump profile.  
We decided one jump was enough for the day and went to a local coffee shop.  I asked to see Gary’s video and he gave me his GoPro.  In 2016 plugging a GoPro into a computer and trying to play the file usually resulted in choppy results and I copied the file to my desktop.  Gary tried to stop me and asked why I was taking his video, he stated that he did not give me permission to get a copy.  This immediately concerned me as I took it to mean a mistake was made and he did not want it to get out.
I watched the video and immediately knew Gary exited and was immediately in a stalled flight.  He had to pitch in an emergency pitch and landed on the highway.  At this point I knew Gary was in over his head and should probably not execute this jump again. I still did not ask Gary about his history with Wingsuit Base.  
At this point in my BASE career I had approached people that I felt were doing things above their experience level by just telling them they can’t do it and never had good results.  I decided the approach I would take would be to provide as much knowledge I had at the time regarding Wingsuit BASE.  Exit technique, angle of attack, what it meant to be jumping in the morning when the talus was shaded with no thermic activity.  Most of the information I was provided was well received, but brand new to him.  I felt by education he would realise he had some progression to work on and it would lead him to a decision to not jump, or jumper slider down.   
That evening we met a non jumper who had a camera that was odd to us.  It was a first generation 360 camera and the person was there to capture video of sunrises etc. The camera had the ability to attach to a GoPro mount.  He asked if I would jump with his 3000 dollar camera.  I said I would and we would plan something that would be a great shot.  This pertains to what you will read below.  
The next morning another friend from Washington and two more locals joined.  The person with the camera hiked with us.  I planned a jump for one local who was tracking to exit first, and set up for a threeway wingsuit flyby.  I would buzz the canopy with one wingsuit on my left and the other on my right in formation.  
Gary packed the slider up and brought his wingsuit.  When I saw this I intentionally hiked next to him and reiterated all the information I provided the day before and asked him to think about if he should jump or go down.  He wanted to jump.
As we geared up Gary asked me if he could join the formation flyby.  This is when I realised all my efforts had no effect on Gary’s decision.  In fact he wanted to add himself to a very technical multiway.  I told Gary sternly that if he decided to jump it must be a solo.  After the flight the day before he needed to focus on his exit and have a safe flight to the LZ opening with sufficient altitude.  I explained that joining our jump would add many distractions and impede his ability to perform, as well as be a potential danger to us.  
I recall Gary being upset and telling me I was just an elite ‘athlete’.  He quickly said sorry and asked if could hang off the rope to watch his flight and give him feedback when we debriefed and I agreed.  What happened next is written below in the original report.  
I recall watching and hearing the impact and turning around and saying “God damn it I KNEW that would happen and I didnt stop it”.  I almost jumped and the local stopped me and said it would only potentially cause more problems if I got hurt.  
We all called rescue and down hiked.  
After years of guilt and remorse I accepted that the decision to jump was his and not mine.  Even if I had stopped him that day unless there was a drastic change of his approach an accident would happen.  But what could I have done differently if I felt so strongly that this was a likely outcome??
If I could go back in time I would have told Gary my true thoughts and that I was just going to drive back to Washington and not join the load because I did not want to be a part of something I felt so strongly against.  Maybe this would have stopped him, maybe it would have led to the same result. The difference is I would not have been there to watch and deal with years of PTSD and guilt for not doing more.  
I should also note gary had taken a break from jumping to recover from an injury.  I cannot remember the details or how long he had between his break and jumping again.
Over the years I have forgiven myself but it still haunts me. I am adding this information to the incident report for two reasons:
If you find yourself in Gary’s shoes, be humble and allow yourself to say to a group that you want to take a step back and progress at a safer site.  
If you find yourself in my shoes, do what you can do to stop the incident and remove yourself from the situation.  Do not allow yourself to be part of something you feel so strongly should not happen.  Do not allow the excitement of being in a new area to not pay attention to your jump partners. I could have stopped the trip before we left Washington

After taking off his gear and re-adjusting his pin into the closing loop, he had packed himself a pin lock malfunction. As you can see, it seems that whilst the jumper was on the exit point closing his bottom pin back, he has not taken the bridle and pc out of its stow and continued packing it differently as to how you would whilst packing after a jump. Because of the pilot chute still in its stow and the bridle tucked away under the bottom closing flap, he has effectively closed it with the bridle on the inside of the closing loop..
This caused the pilot chute when pulled would expand in the air and start the sequence but stopped when it reached the pin because of the way it was figured.
The jumper died immediately after pilot chute/bridle fully extracted and impacted at high speed.
Please, as a warning to others whilst base jumping, take the time to slow down and remember to do all the things you have been trained to do and not skip any steps whilst packing your ONLY parachute."""

Chris had free-solo climbed several hundred feet to the exit point, no other jumpers were present that day and this was his first jump from this exit point. His original flight plan was a more direct path towards the rifugio and to remain visible to the ground crew during the entire flight and deployment. Outside video shows him flying initially towards the east, then turning south, towards the rifugio where he disappears from view of the camera. Other witnesses saw him flying down a gulley, east of the rifugio, then lost sight of him. When he did not land at the primary LZ, ground crew hiked downhill from the rifugio looking for him. Italian Alpine Rescue found his body via helicopter approximately 2 hours later, at the bottom of the gulley, southeast of the rifugio. He struck a tree approximately 60ft uphill, at a 45-degree angle, from where his body was found.
Gear inspection shows the canopy sustained damage from the tree, but the slider was still at the top of the lines, suggesting a low/emergency deployment. The closing loops were intact, evidence the PC had opened the container, not the impact. Injuries sustained and equipment damage suggest a high speed impact. His GoPro was recovered, shattered, without the SD card. Hours were spent searching the impact area on June 25th, but no SD Card was found. The weather conditions were described as light winds from the south, no clouds. The altitude difference between the rifugio (his planned flyby location) and his primary LZ was approximately 300ft. The location where his body was found was at a similar altitude to the Primary LZ.
Chris had jumped that morning, from a different exit point and performed a flyby of a cross next to the rifugio. He landed south(downhill) of the rifugio, on a trail. The planned flight for the second jump was a more direct path to the Primary LZ."

Brito was flying his VRACE and had several jumps on it. They waited at the top approximately for 2 hours because it was too windy. They decided to jump and briefing was a 2 way where Brito exiting a few seconds later would do a flyby at his friend under canopy. But Brito didn't exit and his friend called him from landing. He said winds got gusty and that he would wait. After 15 min he sends a message saying he was exiting in 3 min. After 10 min his friend called and there was no answer. We found his body the next day, hiking because weather became too bad for choppers. He was about 200mts below exit. Camera (selfie mounted) was found 2 days after but just now I saw the video. It looks like he SLIPPED.
After the push, less than a sencond after, he's in a 45 degree bank to the LEFT (opposite side of the line); then about 2 seconds after he's kicking and struggling not to turn on his back as he's at a 90 degree bank. He does not barrel, but recovers, already facing north (line is to the south) and continues to turn left till he finishes the whole 270 and tries to fly away. Video stops seconds before impact. Winds were visible on the grass at the exit, possibly moderate. But I don't think he would have made it even with perfect conditions, just may opinion. He used to exit with his right foot in front. He would advance his right foot and push, in a 2 moves exit. He probably stepped at his legwing and lost grip at his right foot.
Lesson here is very simple. Todays big suits do not allow this kind of exit. I called it DYNAMIC EXIT, if theres another name please correct me. EXITING SHOULD BE ONE MOVE. If you want to exit with one foot ahead, just place it ahead, make sure its clear of the legwing and THEN exit.
Brito had aprox 320 jumps from Gavea alone. He was simply the best of the brazilian crew. An amazingly positive and kind person that hosted a whole lot of people from everywhere at his place. He will be deeply missed, specially by the brazilian community.
Thanks for respecting Brito, OPSMA

He started to pull over the road or very close to it. He was low by then. The canopy inflated right before he impacted in the field crop around 30 meters on the other side of the road. We will never know for sure why Roy Kenneth pulled so low, but there is a couple of elements that might have been contributing factors. Roy Kenneth had felt improvements on his tracking, maybe that was the reason he pushed it to far. The road is a landmark on that jump and its common for people to want to track past it. Also he had complained about his ski-googles he jumped with not being optimal to see through. Roy Kenneth was a good friend, very positive and full of life and an all around awesome guy.

The exit was dry without snow or ice. Exit: 2-way wingsuit, wingsuit solo and Ulli also solo.
The flight in the 2-way was a bit wobbly with wind from the north (headwind).
The 2-way landed in the designated landing area without any problems.The solos followed 5 minutes afterwards.
The first solo had his canopy already open when Ulli appeared. Ulli flew in his wingsuit close to the landing area and initiated the opening. It looked as if he had collapsed all his wings. He stayed for several seconds in that position and then went into an unstable headdown position, which didnt change til impact. PC or canopy were never visible. On the ground the PC was still in the BoC, the container was closed.At the moment we try to find the cause for this no pull.
Ulli Wambach was a master rigger with 9700 skydives and 468 Base jumps, he was my mentor in Base and Wingsuit flying.
UPDATE PLEASE RE-READ.
""After three weeks of thoughts and discussions of all involved friends we think we should say this about the accident:
As we dont have a video from Ulli at the exit point and of his flight we must reconfigure this just by personal views and puzzling.
I personally had been present, had already landed and watched Ullis last flight from the ground.
Just for the record:
It was the forth jump of the day.
Ulli jumped always without gloves and as usual he collapsed his leg wing to a certain degree before he pulled.
According to what I saw we tried to simulate and rehearse the situation on the ground with the same container and suit.
Our conclusion:
With especially the leg wing collapsed by tighter and slightly bent knees there is excess fabric that can move in front of the BOC. When all the forward speed is gone, there is also a trapdoor effect. By this the body is going more downwards and the resulting airstream presses the fabric against the container with additional force, making it even harder to find a PC handle if it is behind it.
With a normal pull, with inflated and stretched leg wing there is no difficulty to reach the BOC/PC.
With the outcome in mind we therefore would like to advise everybody (even if it is common sense to most of us now) not to collapse the wings, neither arm nor leg, on any wingsuit anymore before initiating the pull (like someone may have learnt it at the beginning). Plus that the pull hand should always be intentionally above the arm wing at the pull move by acting clearly over the wing towards the BOC/PC handle. That way no one has to sort through fabric even if the wingtips are released before the pull move is initiated.
The lesson learned from this accident is, that a wingsuit pull is a complex move and should be done out of an open flight configuration with a straight and wide leg position, just folding the arm wing with the pull move as needed.
Of course the flight could be slowed down by flaring the suit a bit just before the pull move itself. But at no time the flight should be slowed down before the pull by collapsing the wings or even stalling the suit.
Then, after the PC is thrown with power and dynamic sideways to avoid the big low pressured burbled space behind the wing, everybody is free again to collapse the wings, bend the knees or decrease arms.
Should there occur an increased opening shock of the canopy, the solution should be searched in better wing collapsing instantly after the pull but at no time before reaching or throwing the PC handle.
Finally there is to state that at no time in this accident there was any evidence pointing towards suit or gear failure.
 
He will be missed and his spirit will fly on with us"

Bixby creek bridge: base fatality and a heroes death
Rami and Katie left to go to Bixby creek bridge. They told friends they planned to jump there, but had a number of other locations planned as well. Phones do not work in that coastal area. They did not return on Friday as they had told people and planned, which was very out of character. On Saturday, Katie was not back in time for work and our concerns turned to fear.
Friends and family did everything they could to talk to people that had heard from them, seen them last, or had plans to see them. A lot of information was offered. If someone contacts you looking for base friends, do not turn the conversation into you trying to get facts unless they are asking for your help on that level. Offer only facts, or at least say this is merely opinion/speculation/possibility or ideas, then be patient and optimistic. Our community is curious and wants information, that is fine, but do not add or interfere with the stress, rescue, investigation. Information will come, helping the situation and our peers is what matters. Protecting objects future jumping potential when friends may be in distress at that location is against everything we stand for as a community. Nothing matters but helping our friends.
A missing persons report brought police to Bixby creek bridge on Saturday evening where they had noted a car in the parking lot for several days. The rental car was registered to Rami. They also spotted what turned out to be Rami's canopy and helmet/camera in the beach below the bridge. The following morning search and rescue went to work. They did not recover anything else. Nothing. Rami was recovered 11 days after the initial Accident sadly Katie has not been recovered to date.
What I have been able to confirm is that his camera turns on and they discuss and plan the jump. Katie will jump first and be pca'ed. Rami will jump second. They choose a small landing area to the jumpers right of the stream that dissects the already small landing area. The area they choose is very small but allows them not to cross the stream, therefor staying dry .
This area is smaller and closer to the ocean, however. The conditions were poor during their prejump and set up. There was a steady tailwind and violent winter swell at near high tide with a smaller than usual LZ. This object appears to be paradise, it is very much a blue to black diamond (using resort skiing technical rating).
Katie was pca'ed. She let out a celebration ""wahoooo,"" then flew the right hand pattern discussed. She turned facing back towards the bridge and simply does not have the penetration expected due to under estimated winds and lack of wing loading. She landed in the wash Of the waves. Her canopy fell behind her in the breaking waves. She was immediately in a struggle in which she was outmatched, as most anyone would have been. Other jumpers have lost canopies on much better conditions. No evidence of the cutaway handle being used or if it would have helped in this situation. She had one on her rig.
Rami briefly watches from the top and didn't say anything, but realizes the situation and appeared to rush his jump. He free fell the jump in a hurried manner. He had a short flight, but clearly is dealing with wind and panic. He had a falling hands, arms, and knees down landing. He stripped his gear. That is where the facts end. Everything else is speculation.
Their jump was on Wednesday, the concerns began Friday, the search party began Saturday evening, the search and rescue worked on sunday. After reviewing video and knowing a violent front had moved through for days they called off the search after one day. There was nothing they could do. Simply the ocean, weather, area, and overall situation was far too extreme.
It's nice to call such a respected jumper a hero, but i would rather call him alive. An early lesson in any emergency response training is not to make things worse by putting yourself in harms way. It only complicates matters for the original victim, the attempted rescuer, and further rescue. Of course, what he did is what legends are made of and nothing can take that away from him or us, but we should all think deeply on whether we would want someone to give their life for our own. This may be speculation too. Simply, we don't know how we will respond in these situations until we are in them. We are a community of extremes, life and death, not living to norms, and going against our fears. I understand and love that.
Rami IS a hero.
...But keep in mind, that losing more life only makes things worse."

Philippe Jean,FRANCE,39,2015-12-26,,,,,,France,BASE Fatality,Earth,Impact in terminal freefall,"Unknown - Unspecified WS, Unknown Wingsuit by Unspecified",Unknown,Unknown,"Slider Up, BOC, BOC","Snow, Sunny, Winds light and variable","Katabatic air flow, Proximity flying","On December 26 at around 3:30pm Philippe Jean attempted to fly line 7 from the Brévent, one of the most western gullies accessible by wingsuit. There is a particularly nice entrance at the top of the line with a tree gate and a grassy slope that provides a visually stunning entrance but can be challenging to access. After reviewing video from Philippe Jeans recovered camera, we know he impacted this grassy slope (altitude ~ 2000m) after reaching to make this point, stalled and lost flight.
I'd like to preface my thoughts by saying, if family and friends of Philippe Jean are reading, that I make the following comments with the intention of sharing a potential lesson with my fellow wingsuit BASE jumpers in an attempt to save lives. It is not my intention to place blame or criticism. We participate in a sport that is still in its infancy and every lesson is extremely valuable to the evolution of our sport. That being said,
The lessons learned here are not new, but perhaps an additional warning to others as more and more people will come to fly their wingsuits at the Brévent.
There are four main factors that I believe are worth mentioning:
- After 3:30pm, at this time of year, line 7 is in shadow with radiational cooling up slope causing katabatic flow, making an already challenging flight to that location much more difficult.
- Philippe Jean was part of a two way. The other jumper exited first and took a very wide right turn while flying conservatively over open terrain, as this was his first time flying so far west. Philippe Jean exited immediately after, looked briefly at the first jumper, passed him and went straight for his line. I believe Philippe Jean held this other jumper in high regards, and he had told me earlier that day that he was excited to show him line 7.
- Philippe Jean was on the phone with a third person via a bluetooth communicator. I have not spoken to the person who was on the other end of that conversation, and don't know the level of communication that was going on, but we all know talking and flying is challenging and potentially distracting.
- Philippe Jean had only flown this line a few times and had not familiarized himself with the visually changing waypoints/landmarks. This was compounded with addition of snow to the terrain; simply, the mountain does not look the same when it has snow on it. We flew this line together once two days before, and he had mentioned after that he was unsure where he was before making the entrance. When we had jumped together I had briefed him at the mid station on how I count three ridges, and look for a rock outcropping on my left and judge my speed and position in reference to that point. Unfortunately we did not discuss how or when we would abort if things did not go as planned.
Philippe Jean sent me a text at 3:25 saying they would jump in the next 5 minutes as I was waiting for two jumpers at the landing area. We had shuttled cars that morning, and I had opted out of the last jump of the day. After the second jumper landed we attempted to call Philippe Jean on the phone. Unsuccessful, we quickly got in my car, checked and alternate landing area, then drove to the PGHM (heli mountain rescue) to report him missing. After a brief search by the heli team, Philippe Jean was located.
Philippe Jean will be missed by many in the jumping, alpine climbing, and High Mountain Military School communities. He had never ending energy, excitement and an infectious enthusiasm for wingsuit BASE jumping. I spent a lot of time with him during the last week of his life and I can say that he fit more adventure, stoke and high fives in that time than some do in a lifetime."

He was well known for making good decisions. He was a natural leader and mentor amongst friends, therefore many jumpers followed his judgement calls. Magnus had been in Walenstadt on privious trips and flown the Crack several times. On this trip, Magnus chose to travel alone. The evening before he spoke with friends and told that he had flown above the Trench Line late in the afternoon, doing reconnaissance at an height he had never done before. He was stoked! This was probably one of the reasons why he chose to fly the Barn Line the next day. He had previously mentioned that he wanted to try this line, but it is unclear if he had done any in depth research of what was required to fly this line.
Magnus was with another jumper just before the exit. They started to talk and it became apparent that they both where going to fly the Barn Line. Hence, they decided that Magnus would follow the other jumper since he had not flown this line before. The other jumper saw later through his rear facing camera that Magnus went to exit but stopped and never followed. This behaviour was not uncommon for Magnus, since he normally where focused on doing a perfect exit with the Aura.
After a brief few minutes the jumper on the ground watched a rescue helicopter land up around the barn area. Bike riders had called in stating they had found a jumper deceased in the vicinity of the barn area.
Everyone who crossed his path will remember him for being very kind, including and generous.

He turned on his back to clear the entanglement. This put him in a leg high, head low body position. At some point during his attempts, the pins popped and the canopy came out. As the PC continued to pull up wards, the bridle attachment point was pulled flush against his leg, turning the canopy upside down. This horse shoe configuartion prevented the canopy from inflating. He impacted just a few feet from the water still entangled and tumbled into the river. It is noteworthy that prior to this jump, Ian had landed in the river and gotten his gear wet. This extra weight and small PC may have contributed to the incident in two ways. The entanglement may have been the result of an over rotation that resulted from a delayed PC inflation due to it being wet. Further, the extra weight of the parachute due to it being wet, coupled with a relatively small PC for a 4ish second delay might have contributed to the entanglement not clearing in time."

We spent the evening listening to stories from Gabe and his grand plans for the summerhe was excited about life, his kids, BASE, and his plans for the summer. We started hiking at 7 am and Gabe was STOKED about the jump. We geared up and neither of the other jumpers on the load checked his gear prior to exit (We did review on video and it looked good). The first Jumper exited and had a great flight, Gabe and I jumped next, he left first and I followed 1 second later. His exit looked good with him ending up a little head high. The following is opinion from video of my flight with Gabe and the other jumper watching the entire flight from the ground following his flight. After exit he really didnt start flying his suit until 100ft over the trees at the end of the talus and the suit was not performing well, this was the start of a 30 sec flight maintaining this distance for the remainder of the flight, with not enough separation we assume he had a problem reaching his BOC.
Ramrod impacted the way he lived his life .FULL SPEED..NOTHING OUT..
We were the first to reach Gabe and found his Pilot chute was still inside the BOC after impact.Ramrod was a legend around here and was well known around the world anyone that knew him will feel this for a long long time.
Gabe was in a Ghost WS with an Apex Summit container and a Blackjack. It was his second BASE WS fight. (the first was from the same exit). The jump on a V5 yields a 55 sec flight with a 500ft deployment.
Gabe WAS the fucking guy!!! I miss him already"

Dean and Graham jumped from Taft point just after sunset. The exit there is not very technically difficult and was opened by myself, dean, and stanley several years earlier. They chose to fly a line through what had been nicknamed ""the notch"". This location is not particularly small, but does require an exit and flight that very few people in the world are capable off. If you have a perfect exit and perfect glide, you will pass over the ridge at around 200ft. If you look at the notch from exit, it looks absolutely impossible, and we used to joke that we would know wingsuits are ridiculous when we can fly over that. Dean had flown through it twice previously, Graham several more than that. I had just had a conversation with dean last week that I thought it was a bad idea and you gained nothing really in the flight by taking that line. He argued that you didnt have to decide until about 15 second if you had to stay committed to the line, and he would only do it if he felt he was flying perfectly. The only proximity involved in this line was however high you could cross the ridge. After you pass through the notch the terrain drops off a cliff.
Deans gf was on exit taking photos. Dean exited first with graham a second or two later. Graham passed dean early in the flight and was setting up on the left side. Graham made a sudden hard right towards the notch for unknown reasons. He passed in front of dean and slid into the right side of the notch where he impacted. Dean made it through the lower portion of the notch to the downhill side, but likely impacted a tree.
Deans gf did not see the impact, but thought they looked lower than normal flying that line. She thought she heard the sound of a parachute opening and rockfall. When she didnt hear from them in 10 minutes she called me concerned that something was wrong. Dean always texted her even before he stashed gear. After 2 hours of no word, yosar was called.
Its unclear if graham made the turn intentionally, because he thought he could not clear the upper ridge, to set himself up for a line through the notch, or because of some unknown weather condition. It is impossible to know if dean was burbled, or was just very low in the notch already. In the best case scenario, this is still an extremely challenging flight. Graham was hyper current and had just returned from a trip opening many exit points in moab including wingsuiting dragons nest. Dean was very current in the valley as well.

Bryan was jumping from the regular exit point of the Perrine Bridge over the Snake River
Canyon in Twin Falls, Idaho, USA. He experienced a closed container impact in deep water. He
was unconscious from impact onward, but was breathing upon initial recovery. His breathing
stopped after recovery onto dry ground, and CPR was initiated by jumpers on the scene
approximately 5 minutes after impact. Professional rescuers arrived via helicopter shortly
thereafter and Bryan was transported to St Lukes Magic Valley Medical Center. He was
pronounced dead by a physician in the Emergency Department around 1:30pm.
Bryan took a short delay (approximately 1.5 seconds) with a closed container and the pilot chute
(PC) stowed in the bottom of container (BOC) pouch.
Bryans PC throw was normal and the pilot chute inflated as expected, achieving full inflation
and bridle extension.
The PC exerted appropriate pull force, as demonstrated by the bridle clearing the channel on the
bottom flap of the container (clearly visible on the video).
The bottom pin remained in the closing loop until impact at approximately 5.25 seconds. During
the freefall, Bryan was in various body positions, beginning slightly head high, then rotating
head low, and finally rolling onto his left side, which was his body position at impact. The bridle
was pulled in various directions by the full force of the PC. In addition, Bryan managed to grasp
his bridle in his hand for approximately .75 seconds near the end of the freefall, but was unable
to manually extract the bottom pin.
On gear inspection, the top closing loop was found intact, and the bottom loop was found
broken, which almost certainly indicates that the bottom pin was still in the loop at impact, but
the top pin had cleared the top loop.
The cause of the container lock cannot be determined with complete reliability. Various
malfunction modes have been discovered on another container similarly configured, and are
detailed in a separate document.
Weather:
The weather at the time of the accident was mild, with temperatures around 60 degrees (F) and
very light winds. Wind at exit was approximately 3-4 miles per hour in the tailwind direction.
Winds at landing were negligible.

The bridle was constructed by Bryan Turner (the jumper) sometime in the summer of 2014.
Closing Loops:
The intact closing loop on this rig was found to be large enough to admit the eye of the pin on
the bridle.
Other factors:
Bryan packed this rig at Centennial Park (at the bottom of the canyon). He was slightly rushed
to finish his pack job, because the other jumpers there had finished packing and were returning to
the bridge and he wanted to ride in their van back to the top.
Bryan did not receive a gear check from any other jumper prior to exit.
This report was compiled by Tom Aiello from video, jumper interviews and gear inspection
immediately following the accident."
Channing Armstrong,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,,2015-02-02,,,,,,United States of America,BASE Fatality,Earth,"Malfunction, Misrigging","Slick, Slick by Everyday Clothing worn",Unknown,Unknown,"Slider Down-Off, Static Line, Static Line","Sunny, Winds light and variable",Gear failure,"Channing and his jumping partner had been very active lately, exploring many new options in the local area. That morning they opened an 180ft cliff with a long canopy flight in rolling green hills. In the afternoon, they elected to scout another exit in the same range.
The cliff was 140 ft above a steep talus with a large meadow at the bottom. Channing went first. He chose to static line without a pilot chute for backup. Using a piece of spectra and a rock as an anchor, he rigged one piece of brake-chord to a loop tied in his bridal, and a backup piece of brake-chord to the pc attachment at the end of the bridal. Upon exit, his container was opened, but his canopy was not brought to full line-stretch.
Local search and rescue was contacted immediately, while myself and two other jumpers made our way to the sight. Channing's partner made his way down, and sent us a gps waypoint of their location. All efforts to retrieve him went well, and we had everyone off the mountain within a few hours.
An inspection of his gear shed some light on the events that unfolded. One length of break-cord was strung through a loop tied ~1 ft. from the end of his bridal. No knot was present suggesting that the knot he tied may have slipped free. (note: there was a 30% nick in the break-cord about 1/2 inch from the end.) Tied to the end of his bridal was a second length of break-cord. We believe that he used two shorter pieces tied together to make one length. He then tied that to the spectra anchor, and then again to his bridal. We believe this cord broke right at the edge of the intermediary knot between the anchor and the bridal loop.
The reason the primary static line knot may have slipped free remains a mystery. As to why the secondary static line broke prematurely, several factors may have contributed:
1. The condition of the brake-cord appeared old and degraded.
2. It was reported by his partner that Channing broke his break-cord apart, rather than cutting it. This may have compromised the integrity of the break-cord prior to its use.
3. Both his primary and secondary static line setups were far towards the end of his bridal, potentially causing higher dynamic forces when loaded.
4. The direction of force applied to the cord as it entered the intermediary knot between the spectra and bridal may have reduced the tensile strength of his break-cord.
Although all his lines were removed from the tail-pocket when he came to rest, his canopy was found with the tailgate still intact.
Had Channing used a pilot chute as a last line of defense, he may have survived that day. Incidents like this highlight the importance of using a pilot chute when static lining and sticking to tested and trusted methods of rigging.
It is with great sorrow that I report this. Channing was a good friend and coworker. His smile was infectious and his sense of humor unmatched."

Once they came to the top, there was a bit of a down climb from the observation deck to the actual exit point. One of the guys wasnt feeling great to begin with and took the gondola down and headed back to the landing area. Three of them climbed down and were throwing rocks for a while and got 4,5 seconds on a toss to 7 and even 8 seconds with a solid throw. Wind conditions were ideal. After 30 minutes or so of checking it out, one of the guys jumped. Donald watched him and felt more confident about it. Two of the guys were working on a project, so they came back up to the restaurant and were later going to go to the other known exit. They told him if he didn't feel like jumping this one, he could just join them at the other exit.
The two guys spent about 40 min in the restaurant, and as Don hadnt come back, they called the guys on the ground to ask if he was down. They said no one else had come down so one of the guys went back to the observation deck to check. Donald was standing on the exit point, geared up and waiting for the clouds to open up. He yelled down to him multiple times to try to get his attention. After about 7-8 times Don notices, and says he can't hear him because of the music. He continued to yell to him to try to tell him to turn it off, and he repeats that he cant hear him. About 20 seconds later the sky opens up and he walks to the edge and jumps. After 4-5 seconds the guy on the observation deck hears the first impact and then the suit flapping until he comes to rest a few hundred meters below.
this exit commanded a strong push as was evident with the rock throw. The first jumper pushed hard but Donald did not. As Donald is 90kg he just did not take off fast enough, and with the lack of push he did not make it past the first ledge at 100 meters (4.5 seconds).
He said he didnt really like it and instead of coming up with the other guys he probably decided to jump because the first guy did and made it. Donald probably got the confidence to jump by watching the first guy get off, but as they never got to communicate with him due to the music, he could not ask what his reasoning was and how he felt about it..
Always know your own limits and compare other peoples performance only if you intimately know them.
Never judge an exit by other peoples performance as it does not relate to what you will do!
Donald was relatively experienced and had the opportunity to turn around with relative ease, but chose not to because of what he saw and felt. Keep the facts real and dont let small variables convice you to go beyond your own comfort zone!"

I was on the load and made a 2-way with Ramon but didn't actually see the accident/impact (like anyone else).
Exit on this jump is not super difficult and either is the flight as well.
You have to clear one ledge but you can always abort and fly away from it at the right time to gain altitude and have more time because it drops to one side.
Unfortunately Ramon continued to fly and when he realized he will not make it over he tried to fly away but it was too late and he pulled but it was too late.
He hit ground just after opening or during and died instantly. Found 2-3 min after by our friend which was watching jump.
We called the rescue services which came really fast.
The hike, day and all was OK.
There was no wind or anything else.
Conditions was perfect.
Ramon did this jump a few days before and flew in the same place much higher.
He was current with his wingsuit.
Lesson to learn like on many similar accidents is to have a reference point where you abort your line or pull. If you go too low just pull or fly away and come back to repeat the jump.
It's not easy to write this and please respect Ramon."

Conditions at the top of the mountain are only speculation as Beau was by himself and because of it's location and height, Siyeh is often effected variably. He hiked in the afternoon, designating a ""turn around time"" with his girlfriend and his parents, who were hiking to the landing area. When Beau didn't arrive, they hiked out to presumably meet him. He never arrived. Rescue was called the following day and Beau was discovered approximately 1000-1200' below the summit, on the lower slabs, wrapped up in is parachute with head and facial trauma. He was wearing a new tracking suit and I know this was his first jump on it. Beau was an accomplished tracker and although not current, was a hyper current BASE jumper, jumping technical objects often with skill and good judgement. The most likely scenario is that Beau had a problem with his exit and had an off heading/object strike. That is of course total speculation but is really the only scenario that makes sense based on the object, the height (4,100' overall), his intention to track it slider up and where he ended up coming to rest.

The exit overlooks the town of Triente and the town of Martigny in the distance. The exit provides a couple of obvious choices to jump from and each involves a technical start that requires clearing a ledge and getting to full flight efficiently in order to have a safe jump.
Several of the pilots had decided not to jump or were undecided as the remainder of us suited up. Rob Herron, Hartman Rector, Scotty Bob and I were geared up and standing just behind Nathan Jones and Alex Duncan, who were standing on independent exits and psyched to do another two way. Both Nate and Alex were very current, skilled, and had been flying together a lot over the previous two months.
After the count, they both exited with strong pushes, Alex, a very, very strong push. It was apparent there was a problem as Alex's trajectory didn't match his push and he was almost immediately in a ""head low, left bank"" body position. As Nate started flying, Alex dove head low and left toward the ledge. He dropped his leg wing aggressively to avoid the ledge but this, in a split second, flattened his body position out, stalling the suit and caused a clockwise flat spin. He impacted the ledge and then the talus below. He died instantly.
Alex Duncan was one of the best wing suit pilots in the world and was known for his humor, bold lines, fast starts and deep friendship. He lived with no regrets and inspired many. He will be missed."

He was an experienced wingsuit BASE jumper flying Line 2 at Brevent, with several jumps from this exit the previous season, flying the same line and others.
This year, he was flying a new suit known to have flight characteristics that differ from his previous suit. One of the notable differences, when comparing the two suits, is how a pilot would fly a very steep line, such as those found at Brevent.
Shaun was hyper-current this season, on his current suit; however, it was said that he did not have as much experience flying this particular suit at the highly aggressive angles required to fly the Brevent lines.
While turning left above line 2, he began a hard dive to get down to the terrain. Shaun stopped his dive around 3-4 meters above the line, just before a slight right turn, where it appeared he exposed too much of the top surface of his wing to the relative wind, causing a downward force on his flying.
To counter this, Shaun made an abrupt change in his angle of attack, which resulted in a high-speed stall, where he lost stability and tumbled to impact."

Arnaud Dumasdelage,FRANCE,,2014-08-06,10,,,,,France,BASE Fatality,Earth,Low pull,"Phantom 2, Beginner Wingsuit by Phoenix-Fly",Unknown,Unknown,"Slider Up, BOC, BOC","Low level clouds, Medium winds, Sunny","Extracted Pilot Chute too late, Loss of speed-glide, Proximity flying","Arnaud just arrived in southern France with his family to spend some vacations. He was excited and really motivated to jump with the locals.
The weather forecast for wednesday was good for pic du Midid'Ossau on the french side of the Pyrénées so we decided to go there. Arnaud hadplanned to use his phantom 2 and this was suited to the jump (proper exit,expected glide ratio on the line ok, a few backup landings on the way, it waseven possible to complete the line under canopy if needed). Arnaud had startedbase jumping in 2004 and was an experienced jumper. He was in shape (running often and some climbing) but it was a while since his last jump.
After a short night we started to hike at 5h15. We werethe first ones that day to reach the top at 9h15. We found the exit ratherquickly, we had a rest and we decided to jump because some clouds were startingto grow. We had some north-west wind (around 10 and 15 km/h at 2880m) but theoverall conditions were excellent.
We started together (1,80m/80kgs/Phantom 2vs1,76m/64kgs/Vampire 4) and 10s later I was flying right above him but80mhigher. He looked quite low for me but I was not sure based on that kindof visual.
After 30s we reached 50% of the line, the distance between uswas around 150m at that moment and he was a bit ahead (meaning good speed forthe P2).
When we reached 75% of the line I saw him opening and halfa second later hitting some trees. I was thinking about opening as welland landing close to him but that part of the talus was not appropriate forlanding so I finished the flight and landed on the targeted field. Network wasnot available for my carrier so I went away to call the rescue team not knowing if he was ok, wounded or even worse.
He was found dead on the crash site by the rescueteam.Later on that day, I've been able to watch his footage. Rightafter the exit he was already low (Around 120m to the ground) and then he wasslowly and regularly loosing altitude. Based on the footage and the visual itwas obvious that he won't clear the end of the talus and he had plenty of timeto open safely. Unexpectedly he kept flying and going down instead of opening.He tried to open when he was around 20m from the ground.
Maybe he didn't want to hike too much to get down, maybehe was not jumping regularly enough to realize he was in a bad situationright after the exit, maybe he wanted to enjoy the ride as long as he could,maybe he had some kind of brain lock, maybe a bit of all of this, his behaviorhere is almost inexplicable. He had plenty of time to evaluate his trajectoryand to open safely but he did not do it, he waited for the last moment to openbut it was too late."

Zack was an experienced jumper, and had recently been to Malaysia, where he had made 40+ jumps, most with aerials. He was a confident but generally conservative jumper, had sound judgment, and was current.
His last jump at this site had been a gainer, but he been frustrated by some off-axis rotation on the jump and wanted to try it again. This evening, due to winds he likely exited from an area that makes the jumper bend down a little bit on exit. It appears that he either stalled or had a slow over-rotation, possibly from the awkward exit position. The pilot chute was extracted, but the pins were not pulled, suggesting either bridle wrap or late pull. Additionally, he had placed his stash bag on his back with the rig over top (big-wall style). This stash bag had an elastic adjusting strap in the middle that had ~6 inches of free slack when the bag was empty. The elastic line was pulled taut when he was found, and so he may have inadvertently pulled the line with his PC, delaying the extraction of his PC.
The site itself is a very dark area, and the ground lighting has not been recently replaced. I believe the moon was low on the horizon or already set, not offering a lot of light. Aerials can be disorienting on a sunny day, and with the low light of this site, it's possible that he lost orientation or lost altitude awareness during the rotation.
Zack was a very well-liked jumper, a great guy, and someone who I admired for his strength and perseverance. He'll be sorely missed."

It was the second time that we did that jump that day. We knew the second part of the flight because there is another exit from which you can enter the same line. We did that lower jump about 20 times already.
The plan on the second jump was to connect these two jumps.
The second part should have looked like this: Fly underneath the exit of the lower jump and fly along the wall. Make a 70° turn to the left and fly over the ridge. (Its a ridge of about 120m length with trees on its left and right, above its a bit flatter and after the ridge it goes down into a canyon which is too steep as that you could fly into it)
The first part of the flight went as planned. So we flew underneath the exit along the wall. Now the turn. For unknown reason, he turned about 100° instead of only 70° to his left. Maybe he just wanted to make a bigger turn to get another angle towards the ridge. He was already low after that turn.
For another unknown reason he tried yet to get over the ridge. So he turned sharp right and lost even more altitude. I separated from him already after the left-hand turn as it wasnt exactly what we planned. I looked down and saw him doing the right-hand turn. He vanished behind the trees and hit the ridge with nothing out. He tried to flare out but he didnt make it for a few meters. The canopy popped out on the impact and he stopped in the little canyon.
What should we learn from this accident.
We all say that we fly with range for errors. But how many errors in a row can you do? 1, 2, 3?
When Murphy's law hits you, you need more than just space for one error. In this case happened two things:
1. Turned too much.
2. Still turned right to get over the ridge.
He had space for the first decision. But not for the second.
Look forward as camera flyer. I had more than one situation in which I was happy I didn't do the same as the pilot in front of me.
Dont fly blind behind without having an idea of whats going on.
If youre concerned about losing a good shot: Walk up and do it again."

He wanted me to jump Sweet Spot as I'm not an experienced jumper and it's massively overhung with a great landing area. We looked for a while but couldn't find it, we found Enterprise though and I decided that we should jump this instead. We sat there waiting for the wind to die, He didn't seem so conviced by it and say he was going for a walk, I guess he was worried about me and wanted to find Sweet Spot. While I was waiting with our friend Evgenii at the exit point we saw him on another fin, he was screaming that he found it. He came to get us and I walked, ran, hand in hand with him to the exit point... We were stoked, Sweet Spot is a Sweet Spot... He asked Evgenii to go first so I was not the first one to jump and he could be with me when I exit. He checked everything my gear and the wind and I went. He had planned a double gainer, as his friend Daniel Moore, who passed a few month ago, had done his first double from this exit point. He was scared, shaking. Evgenii and I waited a long time for him to jump, he kept going back and fourth, turning his camera on and off, screeming ""fuck!"" a few times. Finally, he jumped. He completed his first rotation but stalled the second, by the time he was back belly to earth he said ""Oh shit!"", pulled, I heard the loud sound of impact. The canopy was out but the lines still stowed.
People should learn from this and remember two very basic rules: If you don't feel it, don't do it, and whatever you are doing keep your altitude in mind, better pull on your back than too late.
He was most definitely the best human prototype, genuinely stoked about life and always ready to help anyone without excepting anything in return. He will be greatly missed by those who lives he touched.

His plan was to start a track and then roll over onto his back facing back up towards me, then roll back over to his belly and at this point he'd track left and I'd track right for deployment.
We left the tower at the same time straight into a track... his angle was slightly steeper than mine so he dropped below me. He rolled over onto his back and then back again onto his belly. At this stage he was still a bit too under me so I tracked hard away as I didn't want to be above him when he deployed.
I deployed. He continued to track for too long, deploying right before impact. He had lines and canopy out but no inflation. It took me a few minutes to get down and over to him. He was killed instantly.
After we reviewed his footage we can only come up with the speculation that he has either lost altitude awareness or become fixated on an object as this is where he came to rest next to the only tree in the paddock.
I've jumped with Ash a bit over the Christmas period and we had just become good mates. He was a talented guy and Im so sad and sorry that we have lost another amazing human. My thoughts and condolences go out to Ash's family and close friends through this very tough time."

The last time I saw Dave alive he was relaxed and smiling, sat in the sun on the exit point. His intention was to gear up and jump after watching our flight. From the landing area it is possible to see the exit point and most of the flight line. As we stashed our gear we repeatedly looked back up the wall expecting to see Dave standing on the edge in his red Aura and watch his exit. Somehow we missed it, 45 minutes later I was still waiting, somehow hoping that he had changed his mind and walked back to the cars. Not knowing what had happened but hoping he had not jumped we hiked the 3 hours back out. On Arrival back at the car it was obvious Dave was not there. It took us 30 minutes of studying the talus from above to locate what we believed was Daves red wingsuit.
He was in an inaccessible location 1500ft below the exit. We called 911 and requested search and rescue assistance.
Due to a lack of remaining daylight a rescue helicopter was not able to reach the area until early the following morning. When the aircraft arrived, it quickly located Daves body and confirmed he had died from massive injuries resulting from impacting rocks at high speed. Death is believed to have been instantaneous.
The pilot chute was out of the BOC but the pins and the container were still closed. The position of his body on the talus was consistent with him impacting the terrain about 15  20 seconds after exit, while in low level proximity flight. This was Daves third flight in the last three days, down the line he was flying. As always he started conservatively and got progressively lower. There had been a lot of discussion about the lines we were flying, the outs and the visual illusions created by the different sized rocks. The angle of the terrain is such that at almost any point on the line he was flying it should have been possible for him to gain altitude for a safe deployment.
Sitting around our camp fire the night before Daves death he could not have been happier. He talked about his life, his work and the days jumping with equal enthusiasm. It is my belief that he loved where he was in life.
Daves death will be a loss to everyone who knew him and everyone who now wont get the chance to meet him.
Fly free Dave, forever free.

Jumper was a very experienced skydiver with AFF rating and tandem master and a few thousand skydives...
Which is why the base community cant understand why he felt the need to rush into base jumping and jump a wingsuit on his 10th base jump. Witnesses stated Max made 12 jumps in the valley in the days, leading up to the incident.
The jumper exited from yellow ocean, an object that has a 350^ meter rock drop and only 425 meters to the landing area. His Flying in his wingsuit (venom) was very head high and slow and therefore likely flying in a stall.
The canopy gets to line stretch but at the same time he hit the ground the canopy and bridle draped over the power lines (lower voltage).
There was 2 joined possible causes for death... Impacting ground at extreme force was the primary cause of death (possible low pull or pc caught in burble).
1.) This jumper had only 10 low altitude BASE jumps and ignored all advice from his fellow travelers and jumpers in the valley at the time.
2.) This jumper didn't register for the Landing card making it hard for Police to identify him and contact his family. He had no information from the SBA nor informed himself on the various exits and their profiles.
3.) This jumper assumed yellow ocean was a suitable exit for beginners, not considering that this exit doesn't have sufficient height to practice Wing-suit flights!
4.) Excellence in skydiving experience can help awareness and reactions in BASE, but it doesn't substitute proper training and preparation in this very different environment!

There were 4 local Austrian jumpers and myself, an Australian jumper. All jumpers were experienced and 3 out of the 5 jumpers had previously jumped this particular object. All were proficient wingsuit flyers.
Although early, the mood was very cool and exiting. We arrived at the start of the hike to find quite a lot of early morning fog, which obstructed the view of the top of the mountain but as a group we decided to start the hike with the hope that the fog would lift. Although a long hike (3 hours approx) it was not a dangerous one and we could turn back at any time if the weather got worse.
The hike took us directly up the same line that we would soon fly so the whole way we knew the gradient of the terrain. The terrain was quite smooth but also slightly flat in some sections and was a jump for big suits only. Because of the coming and going cloud cover on the walls of the valley, there was no way for the 2 jumpers that hadn't jumped this wall before to get 100% view of the different lines that could be flown. The deceased jump had flown this jump just 1 week before.
After a long and pleasant hike with friends we arrived at the top and the gear up area to mixed cloud cover and only glimpses of the ground below. It was not too cold as the sun was coming out on occasion so we decided to wait on the exit point until it cleared up. We sat on the exit point for approximately 1 hour. The mood was still great as we joked and told stories.
At one point, the deceased went to go and look for another exit point and was gone for some time. During this time the sky opened up and was clear and safe to jump. The four of us remaining geared up and went down to the exit point, which was a very clean and safe exit point. The rock drop was between 7 & 8 seconds.
Not knowing if the cloud would come back in again, we decided to start jumping before the deceased returned. The first two jumpers exited and had good, safe flights disappearing around the corner. I was finishing my gear up when the deceased arrived back. He came to the exit point to watch the last two of us jump but was not geared up himself. I went next and had a good exit and a great overseeing flight. I personally understood after exiting that this jump was not so much a proximity flight but just a beautiful flight in the Alps. I decided not to go to close to anything but to fly over everything and check it all out. The talus was long and not so steep.
From here on in it is not 100% sure what happened but we are also pretty certain..
The last jumper exited and had a safe flight to landing. I flew to another landing area further down the valley and waited there for some time for the last 2 jumpers. I only saw 1 jumper. After some time I went to the trail to find one of the jumpers walking back to try to contact the deceased jumper by phone as they had not seen him fly out and should only have been no more than 10 minutes behind us.
The question was asked that maybe he had gone to jump the new exit point that he had found in which case we wouldve kicked his butt but this was just an assumption and we were almost certain this would not be the case.
Eventually we all walked out to the car park and one of the jumpers headed back to the landing area with a radio in hope the deceased would land there. In time though we knew something was not right and the rescue helicopter and police were called in to help with the search.
We were all content to bring emergency crews in, in hope that this would just be an embarrassing moment for us base jumpers.
This took way longer than we thought and we all became worried for the worst. The rescue chopper finally came and flew straight up into the gorge to start the search. After approximately 10 minutes the chopper came back and landed. This is when we received confirmation that Bernie was dead.
The Assumption..
The deceased was a very experienced & talented skydiver and was just getting into wingsuit proximity flying. After viewing his camera angle it appeared he had a good exit and flight but whilst proxy flying the right line he turned right into the terrain up a crack. However this was the wrong crack and it came to a dead end with no way out. The line he should have flown was another 20 meters further down the valley.
After viewing my head cam angle from flying above all the features, it is clear to see the dead end crack into which he flew.
Something to think about
It is so important to know the lines you are flying and to not go too hard on them until you have a full understanding of where you are going. Turning around blind features is extremely risky unless you know exactly what is around the corner.
So many wingsuit fatalities could have been prevented if the people just slowed down a little and checked out the terrain properly. You dont have to do everything this year, you can save something for the future. Longevity is the key.

Fernando impacted a flat part of the ridge after about 30 seconds of flight. he did not appear to have attempted to pull his pilot chute. there was one witness from the exit. i was the third jumper and had visual on Fernando for most of his jump, excluding the last 2 seconds when i bailed into the canyon to the right not wanting to commit to the terrain. The first jumper had a good flight with plenty of altitude. I felt the strong head wind and subsequent lack of speed on my flight. SPOT devices were activated immediately and the jumper still at the exit hiked higher up the mountain to gain reception and talk with local emergency response directly. fruitless attempts were made from both sides of the ridge to reach Fernando by foot before the helicopter arrived and began it's search.
 
Variables:
- Fernando had only 10 jumps (total BASE and skydive) on this particular suit
- the decision to do a three way and the flight path were decided on the exit moments before jumping without time for mental preparation.
- this particular line had never been flown before
- Fernando hiked twice the day before and commented on ""feeling that second hike"" as we approached the exit. the hike is about 3 1/2 hours with the entire altitude of the jump done on foot.
- later then planned start to the hike had us at the exit after 11am.
- wind was discussed, but it's importance was trivialized by our confidence in our ""big"" suits
Analysis:
as in most BASE jumping fatalities a COMBINATION of less then ideal variables brings about the tragic result. change any two of those, probably any one and the result could have been different. terrain-proximity experience, experience level with a particular suit, fatigue levels, wind, jump order, flight plan discussion and preparedness (especially on new exits or lines!) and your gut feeling all need to be considered before jumping. Fernando was a talented climber and jumper and super-psyched dude. he is deeply missed by his family and friends."

Paul had a good start and uneventful flight until he reached the entrance of the crack rather high, Paul started diving, and after a sudden jolt he started oscillating sideways for unknown reasons, loosing speed and altitude fast. Oscillation got so strong that it maybe flipped him over once (can not be said for sure based on video). 2nd jumper reported that just before he lost him out of sight it looked like he got stable again.
Search was called off a few days after the accident, it was too dangerous for search parties because of avalanches and falling rocks. The Schattenbachschlucht (this is what the ""cracks"" name) is very difficult terrain and is described as ""Difficult High-level Alpine hike"" including mixed-climbing pitches in tourguides. The Schattenbachschlucht is very steep, and also very narrow at the bottom, and opening inside is not an option over flying out with the suit, which leads as to the assumption that canopy was not pulled. On Friday, April 26th Pauls body was found in the Schattenbachschlucht, the body had to be recovered by a team of mountain climbers because it was unreachable by helicopter.
Paul was a very experience basejumper, paragliding pilot, and mountaineer. He was know to be very rigorous when it came to gear and had in-depth knowledge of rigging and aerodynamics."

- A few jumps at Brento
- 70 base jumps on his X2
-35 normal base with tracking and slick
Coming from a jumper on the load
I was at the exit just behind Frank. I closed my leg wing when he said, a smile in his voice ""321 Base"". I looked up and saw him, a second, poking his head down and his feet quickly exceeded the vertical (with great amplitude). he arched up to try to compensate (I had already seen him before exit in this way and then recover). He disappeared from my sight about 2.5 seconds after exit. I am unable to say whether I heard the impact 4 or 10 seconds is too confusing.
The Ramp was introduced this same day,
Franck went up in his x2 wingsuit to the high ultimate, he pushed off harder then normal and resulted in a head down position... he was out of control and narrowly missed the first ledge whilst trying to regain his flight position where he went into a spin and never regained control and impacted next ledge killing him instantly,
Although he had very few basejumps he was current in the suit as he had been jumping it most of the season..
This fatality is a mirror image of #161 Gary Muppet harbird
Please remember that although you may be experienced wingsuit or tracker every jump is different and just because you nail every exit before there is always a exit you will blow and if you choose an unforgiving exit then this will only stack up your odds of pulling it off if you receive a bad exit.
High Ultimate is also recommended to be a Experienced tracking ONLY exit, just because there is a ramp it is still underhung

Sean's was the first of a two way and had an effective launch. The first half of his flight appeared normal with adequate forward speed. During the last half of his flight he appeared to lose speed and seemed to be sinking out. He changed his flight path slightly in an attempt to maintain altitude above a gully and kept flying towards the main landing area. After deploying his pilot chute the canopy inflated with a left off heading of about 140+ degrees and after a few seconds he disappeared from sight into the gully and behind a cliff band.
By the time Sean was located by other members of the group he had already passed.
Sean had recently changed wingsuits and within the weeks prior to his accident fellow jumpers had noticed he was not maximizing the new suit's performance. Sean was known as a safe and conservative jumper and his passing was a shock to many who knew him.
In this day and age of rapidly evolving wingsuit technology and the boundaries of free flight constantly expanding, pilots need to be aware of their personal capabilities. Wingsuit base jumpers should not venture away from forgiving objects before they have a substantial history of stable, precise and fast flights appropriate to the performance of their chosen suit. Stalling, short or inconsistent flights should be understood as indicators of more training on forgiving objects or better yet from airplanes.
Be aware of your capabilities"

Both jumpers were 1st to arrive at exit point and geared up on their own, they did not check each other and the other jumper did not see Hans checking his gear (not to say it didn't happen, he just didn't see it) Phoenix fly tracking suit, no go pro's apparent.
They were first to jump in a 2way from exit 6, both pulled at a reasonable safe height. Hans experienced only partial canopy extraction, approx 10ft of long skinny canopy not catching any air, being pulled by the pilot chute kept him in a belly to earth position until high speed impact on talus proving fatal.
Heli had reached the body before any jumper could, so no initial inspection of gear was undertaken.
Some theories are
Left packing clamps on gear
pull up cord left in pins after packing
pilot chute in tow
 
It seems although he did everything right at this stage. pulled at safe height, was not a low puller and also had enough seperation.

Report(s) compiled from many first hand accounts (not edited):
Here the report of Marcus´s accident.
It was Marcus 336th Base jump, most of them Track jumps, about 30-40 WS jumps on a P2, which he also jumped this day.
I had problems with my ribs, so I brought him and the others to the cable-car and waited at the landing. Everything was normal this day, except that Marcus was thinking during the whole hike and also the evening before about flying proximity to the ledge or not.
He was not sure about doing it or not. It was his first jump at Kandersteg. He exited second, had a good exit and was flying a straight 30° left line (report from the jumper behind him).
He flew over the ledge and had no problems till this point. I could not see his flight till he passed the ledge. When I heard the opening, which was very loud, I looked up and saw him under canopy about 30m after and 30m under the ledge. He had multiple line twists and opened 160° right. He opened his right Zipper and his left one to the half, then he impacted first time very hard. The wall was not straight down, so he impacted several times till it ended up in a 150m free-fall with collapsed canopy. He had no chance.
Why he opened at this point is difficult to say, but:
It was his first time going proximity, his first jump at this cliff, he has not seen the landing and the ledge/jump from the landing area at, he was thinking about doing it or not. In our opinion, all this decisions together resulted in pulling at this point (panic, stress or whatever).
The question is if it´s worth to die for a nice video.....

Around 7 :15 or so we started our trek up the hill. We made small talk and cracked jokes. At one point Shane had me rolling when he tried to demonstrate how he was going to throw his trekking poles in his suit along his legs and they dug in, causing both pole handles to nut punch him at the same time. We hiked and talked and he showed me some huge holes in the rock formations. We reached our exit point at around 9. I remember saying to Shane that I was thankful that he could so accurately appraise my skill level and take me to places I was comfortable. In return he said "" I'd much rather have a beer at the bottom with you than get you some cool guy video"". We talked about the lines we would fly and when I Get home I can show you them all on a map but for the time being let's just say there was a right and a left line. The left was more technical but Shane insisted I would have no problem with it. There was an easy out to the right before you get to committed. We exited as a two-way with me in front. My extremely timid flying made me want to look on the other side of the hill before going over so I flew at a diagonal to it. After a few seconds I saw Shane's bright yellow apache power up and go blazing by, headed straight for the ridge. He threw me an enthusiastic head nod that any jumper can tell you translates directly to "" hell ya!"" and then he was back on task flying very aggressively in what base jumpers call ""attack"" mode. As I passed to the side of the terrain feature I was traveling around I gave one last glance under my wing at shane. He was in a left hand turn around the corner, and then he dissappeared from view. He impacted in a grass field near a chalet. I spent the rest of the day in a SAR helo looking for him. The PGHM which is the search and rescue unit here are amazing. They pulled out all the stops to search for Shane and did him a great honor. I know this is a discombobulated after action report but it's really the meat and potatoes of the whole thing.

On the morning of the 7th July 2012 several different groups of experienced jumpers all showed up at the same time to get on the first cable car to go to the cliff Kandersteg. All were in wingsuits.
The weather was perfect. Not too hot nor cold with a slight breeze at the exit point and in the valley below. Perfect conditions.
There were at least 15 jumpers on the exit point and all were in good spirits with a good vibe. Jumpers were exiting and flying both the left line & straight out, with a majority of people flying the right-line. The Deceased, Alan McClandish was about 3 jumpers behind me on the exit. He had mentioned to a fellow jumper that he was a little tired but nothing really out of the ordinary. We joked as perusual and I said to him on exit the standard thing Have a good one with a handshake.
After flying the left line I landed safely at the cafe and proceeded to watch as a couple of other jumpers exited, flew & opened safely.
For Alans jump I did not see the exit but I saw the second half of his flight, which was looking excellent with good speed & glide. It also looked as he was flying a very tight line.
The next part of the jump seemed weird because as he flew to where a large ledge was he started a turn and then disappeared out of site for possibly up to 3 seconds. I was expecting him to fly out from the other side of the ledge but instead there was a very distinct sound of an impact as myself,and at least 10 other jumpers watched him bounce down an almost sheer wall. The canopy appeared to be out but it was a ball of shit. He bounced for possibly about 250 meters and came to rest on a ledge approximately 200 meters up.
I instantly called the Rega helicopter and there were there within 15 minutes for what we all knew was body retrieval. It was suggested that all the other jumpers leave, as there was nothing that could be done. Myself and Alans best friend Benny waited for the chopper and instructed the rescue guys and the doctors on what had happened.
After less than an hour they retrieved Alans body and we confirmed that it was him.
Initially we had thought he had hit the cliff head on but this was not the case as his head and face did not show this type of impact.
After talking with Benny who also saw the impact from below where it happened we came up with this assumption.
Alan was one of the fiercest wingsuit pilots on the planet when he used to fly his S-Fly wingsuit. His flights were unmatched by any other.He had recently started flying a V4 and was having troubles flying it due to the completely different styles of flying. He had made approximately 12 jumps on the suit and the last 2 jumps he seemed to get it to fly very well.
Myself and Benny think that as he was flying so well on this jump that he went back into hardcore mode and decided to fly a tight line to the right. He was higher than most people who fly this line and we think he was trying to get over a large ledge that was also wide. From another angle you can see this very noticeably. We think he realized at the last second that he wasn't going to make it over and he initiated a fairly sharp turn to miss the ledge.Although he could turn on a dime in his S-Fly, he hadn't practiced turning sharply on the V4. We think he impacted on this ledge, which was covered in grass. This also explains the 2-3 seconds where no one saw or heard him as the impact made no sound. We think that after the initial and fatal impact he either slid of rolled down this ledge and back into free fall and it was this time when we all heard and saw the impacting down to where he came to rest on the ledge.
He was wearing a camera and helmet but there were no signs of them from the rescue team.
I want to say a HUGE thank you to the Police and the rescue team involved in this tragic accident. They did an amazing job and were very compassionate and professional throughout the whole event.
Alan was a very experienced base jumper and a very hard-core one at that. He knew the risks involved in this sort of flying and that any miscalculation could result in serious injury or death.
I can only ask that all base jumpers please take care out there, especially the good ones, as it is now the experienced guys dying.
Do you need to be one foot off the ground?
Do you need to hit trees?
Is that one second of joy worth losing your life for?
Do you want to put your friends and family through this sort of trauma?
I urge everybody to just slow down a little and enjoy the bigger picture. Alans passion for base jumping was huge and now he can never jump again!
There is nothing wrong with flying at 70-80% of what you are capable of. I personally run at 50-70% most of the time to keep stuff in reserve.
Please be safe out there

(I jumped a few minutes before Hervé and hiked back to where he impacted afterwards)
We found no eye witness of the accident.
From this exit you can pass a ridge on your right, then depending on performance you can either fly to the left in two different valleys, or keep flying to the right and try to pass a grassy, flat and long plateau further away and join another valley. If performance is finally not good enough to pass this plateau, you have time to pull and land there.
According to jumpers at the exit, Hervé's flight was very performing, he was high above the first ridge on the right. Consequently he was in a good position to try to clear the plateau. What we suppose is that his performance dropped in the second ! part of his flight (it happened to him sometimes) and that he couldn't pass the plateau.
His canopy was retrieved with slider still attached and brakes stowed, due to lack of eye witness we don't know if the impact made the canopy come out of container or if the impact occured at the beginning of opening sequence. So we don't know what exactly happened : no pull / late pull / failed attempt to pull / other malfunction.
The only sure thing, considering the impact location, is that it wasn't a failed proximity attempt."

update from Mäthu / SBA
So, here is what happened:
Markus jumped the Via Ferrata alone in late afternoon and in calm conditions, no turbulence. He was flying his Apache that he had been using for quite a while already. He felt comfortable in the suit - that's what he told me on several occasions during the weeks/months before the accident.
A credible eye witness saw Markus flying left after the exit along the wall towards Lauterbrunnen. He was flying stable and with a very impressive glide. At about two thirds of the way to the waterfall and still very high up he initiated a right turn to separate from the wall. After about 70-80 degrees and while still turning he suddenly went steep, respectively nosedived, which resulted in an abrupt ""frontflip"". The exact kind of flip/rotation and in which position he came out of it cannot be said with enough certainty. After this flip he could have recovered easily as he was still very high. Instead he was tumbling towards the ground as if he was unconscious: no trying to recover, no struggling, no flat-spinn, nothing, just falling like a stone with flapping fabric on it. This tumbling part of the flight was also seen be another witness. Moreover, the coroner mentioned that the body was ""unusually relaxed"" and not stiff like other bodies of basejumpers that he had treated, supporting the presumption that Markus was unconscious. Markus impacted the field west of the bridge near the waterfall with nothing out and died instantly. We inspected his gear and it is obvious that the pilot chute was still in the BOC when he impacted. Everything on the gear looked okay, including the wingsuit.
What caused the abrupt nosedive resulting in a flip we will never know exactly. Our assumptions are:
1) Markus suffered a sudden health problem, be it a heart attack, a stroke or just a momentary black out.
2) The wingsuit stalled during the turn, went into an aggressive nosedive and with a resulting negative AoA flipped Markus abruptly, rendering him unconscious. This theory could be backed by the fact that Markus' flightpath was considered ""very high"", meaning he must have been close to stall speed on the polar curve, invariably leading to the danger of a dynamic stall while turning. Additionally, by design a large wingsuit such as the Apache is more prone to radical stall behaviour.
That is all we could find out."

This wall has a ledge at about 8 secs which you cannot out-track, recommended free-fall time is around 5 secs. The jump was a 2-way, Sergio went first. This was his 2nd jump from this cliff within a few days. Sergio had a slightly unstable exit which turned his body to the right.
According to pics taken in free-fall by the jumper behind him he stayed in this position for several seconds before slowly recovering to a straight position
and then started to track. He deployed his canopy at about 7 secs and impacted the ledge during the opening of the canopy. The canopy did fully inflate but never really started to fly, he impacted the ledge several times before coming to a stop.
Emergency service was called immediately by witnesses on the ground and a helicopter arrived about 30 mins later but the doctor who was dropped could only determine the death
of the jumper. His injuries confirm a high-speed impact, he died immediately.

external witness report from The Salt Lake Tribune
I was hiking in the canyon and saw her fall. I heard the sound of her parachute opening. Her parachute appeared to open all the way but unfortunately not in time to avoid a fairly hard landing. She rolled and slid about 20 feet down a steep slope before coming to a stop. There was no movement for a few minutes but then I saw her sit up and then lay back down again. Rescuers arrived in the canyon in just a few minutes and it took another 15 minutes or so to hike to where she was. A biker had already hiked up to her while I directed the rescue crew to the right spot. When the biker came back down, he said she was breathing but couldn't get a response from her. The rescue crew performed CPR but were unsuccessful. The most frustrating part was that she came so close to making a good jump. Her chute was open but she was about 3/4 of the way down when it did. She needed just a few more feet. It did seem to me to be a rather short cliff to make such a jump but I have no experience. The margin for error seemed to be very small."

His body was found dead on a ledge under the power lines, entangled in his bridle. He was flying a S-Bird.
Given his lifestyle and accomplishments, it's hard to figure out why he decided to start wingsuiting on his own as he had many friends in the WS base-jumping scene. He was a top-level athlete, very experienced in many aerial sports and has been managing risks in remote alpine environment for years.
He will be greatly missed here, but we can be pretty sure that he's now inventing new sports with his brother up there in the sky.
Antoine was one of the most accomplished athletes in his sport. Born into a family of sportsmen, Antoine grew up in the wide open country between the Lake Geneva and the Alps, and learned to ski from the moment he could walk. He soon got a taste of the wealth of outdoor activities that such an open environment offered.
Antoine was just nine years old when his older brother, Valéry, an experienced hang-gliding and paragliding pilot and a pioneer in speed riding who was killed in an accident in 2006, introduced him to paragliding. He instantly caught the bug and soon became an experienced pilot. After becoming a certified instructor in skiing and paragliding, his love of the mountains and his insatiable appetite for thrills led him to the top of these two sports.
What he loved most of all was to be in the mountains, climbing up the slopes ready to make his descent by whatever means available: extreme skiing, base jumping or speed riding.
His talent was matched only by his imagination for ways to get back down to the valley floor. Even though he achieved some amazing feats, Antoine's exploits in alpine skiing were not widely known. But unlike many extreme skiing purists, Antoine was first and foremost an inventor. He liked finding unlikely routes and blending types."

""we decided to go to Varan arrow to jump this big wingsuit flight. Weather report was great, sunny and no wind. We wanted to do it the days before but it was too windy in altitude (exit is around 2500m). It was his 8th jump of the week. We arrived around 10:30am at the exit, perfect conditions, no wind.
We found the exit as described in the topography map as it had a canne in place.
Fabrice saw a pillar on the very far right side of the exit and decided to go and see. He told me ""I am going to see and come back if not good"".
I stayed on the normal exit, with a very bad feeling inside. We have done some more technical jumps, and this one was normal ok for us. When he arrived at the top of the pillar he said to me it was good and he was going to get prepared. I will prefer to go down but I prepared to jump as well (I was flying Xbird).
Fabrice went first as he liked to jump first. I saw the beginning of his jump, normal without problem. He passed behind the corner of the wall, and I heard a big noise (as canopy opening) then a second very loud noise..
He was found by rescue paramedics 15 mins later lying down on a ledge as in flying position, canopy over him, lines out of tailpocket . Impacted ledge on line stretch...
 
It is a big loss for all of us but mainly for his wife Michèle and his family.

Jeremy was a highly decorated combat veteran of the United States Marine Corps, skilled big mountain climber, and a great friend...the best always go first...RIP dude
update:
Jeremy's canopy suffered from multiple line failure on opening.
Multiple factor seems to be involved : high lines made of 400lb dacron, heavy jumper, full-speed-track pull.
It brings the question of structural absolute needs for our sport. We have been pushing the limits, asking for lighter and lighter gear... BASE gear has been overbuilt from the beginning, and as users we are more and more neglecting gear maintenance and structural limitations.
There's been case of slider-down opening at terminal velocity with only minor material damage - this was the way to go until we wanted to increase the performance. Light gear is great. But it has drawbacks.
We have to learn a major aspect of modern gear through this tragic accident.
Each jumper have to figure out what the gear is designed for and what are the limitations.
Manufacturers should together define a minimal standard for structural strength that has to be respected, whatever the clients are asking for.
We rely on a single canopy system - which has now a very low failure rate. We can not afford having underbuilt material appearing on the market just because of the new trend of lightweight and low volume gear."

We jumped a 2-way wingsuit from the Via Ferrata exit I was on the left side with
a v4 he was on the right with an X-bird I jumped first so I did not know what happened later on
witnesses told me that he had a good exit and after like 2 seconds he started to turn to the wall
and he impacted the ledge under the exit on full speed the canopy came out on impact it gave me some hope
because i did not see how it happened but when rescue reached him they told me he had no chance.
New information:
There seem to be a potential problem with asymmetric arm wing inflation on the early X-Birds versions. Many jumpers experienced unexpected turns just after exit. The size and location of the air inlet seem to be the major factor involved.
There is a video of such incident here 
Cable Dave's last jump was looking similar in dynamics, it's highly suspected that his left wing experienced the same inflation issue. Given the distance he was from the first jumper, it's not yet possible to say if the turbulence of the first WS played a role or not in that inflation process, but it's very not likely to be the main factor."

What we had planned:
An evening jump from cliff (Chamonix area).
8 jumpers on the hike / jump.
On the way up we discussed the possible lines we could fly.
Half way up, we stopped to check the options, and decided which line each of us would fly.
Three of us decided to fly the far left line over the paragliding start area. A camera was set up with my wife and Edo's girlfriend at this position.
All the jumpers decided to also fly the left line, but after the black ridge, turn right and fly some tree lines or gorges (This is a steeper, shorter and safer line which allows for some nice terrain flying).
After two hours we reached the exit point, where the weather conditions were great. No wind, just a light breeze and partially sunny.
We all got geared up and ready to jump, during which time Mirko mentioned that he was tired.
He was quiet, but this was more than likely due to the long hike we had made.
Despite this, he was very positive about the jump, gearing up quickly and in a happy manner  just being typical Mirko.
What we saw (facts):
From the exit point
Mirko jumped as the last jumper of a 3 way group.
His exit was good, leaving a longer separation between him and the jumper before him  this was to allow him to have nice clean exit in front of him.
His start was a bit slow, but nothing out of the ordinary, and gave us no cause for concern.
Mirko flew with decent speed until he disappeared from view behind the pillar on the left, just like all the other flyers of the 3 way group had done.
What the girls saw from the ground:
They saw the 3 way coming and at one point the last flyer turned to the right. They saw the flyer disappear behind the ridge.
After the first and second jumpers canopies opened, Mirko, nor his canopy could be seen.
After we landed we realized that Mirko was missing. Heli search & rescue was informed and the helicopter came very quickly to begin a search.
After a solid hour, they couldn't find him, so a ground search was started, organized by the Mountain police. They worked through the night, but still could not find Mirko.
At first light the next morning, the helicopter was again used to search from the air. They found his body and recovered him.
Mirko was found high up in the gorge saddle, before the tree line.
His canopy had been opened, lines were out of the tail pocket, stretched and the toggles were on the risers. The shrivel was pulled on the bridle, indicating that the canopy was not out due the impact, but that Mirko had attempted to deploy.
The area he was found in was impossible to see from the exit point.
The doctors confirmed he died from massive head trauma as a result of impacting with the wall at speed.
Although Mirko was wearing a camera, it was not found or recovered.
What we believe happened:
The left line requires a quick decision and reaction after turning at the pillar as the black ridge stands there like a fence.
If a jumper decides that he cant make it over the ridge, they must immediately make a right turn to avoid being over the trap.
It is possible that Mirko found himself lower than expected and took too long to decide if he could make it over the ridge or not.
By the time he had made the decision, his ability to fly the alternate line had gone and he would have found himself too close to the ground and wall, impacting during an attempted deployment."

Max, 23, around 120 BASE jumps, including 50 wingsuit, is doing a 2-way from an exit he knows very well. He jumped many times from that spot during the whole winter season, with and without wingsuit.
This jump is a 350m cliff that gives access to a total 700m until landing into a large grass field. The weather is good.
They both did a perfect patrol flight until the opening. Max was higher than his mate who pulled at normal height and lost eye contact. During his opening he saw Max passing by, arms on his back, apparently falling fast and trying to reach his PC in his leg pouch.
Max impacted the talus at full speed with his PC in.

The BASE jumps were all within the last 8 months.
His final jump took place around 4:30 Sunday afternoon.
Winds that afternoon were around 15-20kts slightly cross wind from right to left of the exit point.
This was not the first jump that day, Lucas was on the ground observing the first jumps deciding if he was comfortable jumping in the conditions.
He had done a few gainers from this object in the past, all very controlled and well executed.
The tower in question has 2 exit points where the guyed wires attach, one at 340ish ft and the lower one at 270ft approx.
The attachment points overhang the tower around 1.5-2m and provide a nice platform to exit.
The jump was a 2 way, Lucas was exiting from the lower platform performing a stowed gainer, the jumper on the higher platform was doing a go & throw.
On this jump he had a good exit and the rotation of his gainer was perfect.
On this attempt though he began his deployment sequence too early, a bit past a horizontal back to earth position.
At this point rather than deploy the PC he extracted it from the BOC but held onto it.
We are not sure of the reason for this, I have never seen him do this previously on any of his base jumps or all the skydives we have done together.
He only held onto the PC for a split second but within this time the bridle extracted from the BOC/PC to full stretch behind him, it was at this point with the rotation of the gainer that his foot rotated through the bridle. He released the PC but it was already entangled around his foot.
He went for the risers but quickly realized that the PC was snagged and tried to free it. Either the kicking or PC drag extracted the canopy but it became entangled around his leg.
He impacted with no canopy inflation and died instantly. Another jumper was with him seconds after impact to help, checking vitals but there was nothing that could be done.
I believe if he had of released the PC as soon as it was extracted from the BOC he would of been fine, a head down deployment at worst.
Lucas was a very smart and skilled jumper. He was also one of my best friends, his enthusiasm, passion for life and positive traits were endless.
He will be greatly missed amongst a huge circle of friends both jumpers and non.
Still miss you every day buddy, it was a honor to call you my friend"

""Gary ""Muppet"" Harbird was a very experienced skydiver and base jumper with about 8000 and 400 jumps respectively. He was very current on his V1 wingsuit at the time of the accident. Gary had jumped the High Ultimate once before but this was the first time with a wingsuit. Many of the locals were/are divided over whether this is a safe wingsuit exit or not but Gary decided to give it a go, fully knowing the risk. Only seeing the exit from my point of view it can be speculated what exactly happened. Gary pushed off hard and out with both feet from a standing position at the end of the platform. As he disappeared out of view, he appeared to be rotating head down with more than usual speed. I rushed to the end of the platform for a better look and saw the topskin of his fully inflated canopy only 500 or 600 feet below the exit. The canopy made a slow righthand turn with no signs of human input and disappeared back out of view while flying towards the cliff. Gary and his canopy became entangled with a shrub about halfway down the cliff where his body remained until being recovered by longline about 45 minutes later. Gary had severely impacted his head at some stage hard enough to make his Protec helmet and gopro come off. He also had severe trauma to at least one leg. This makes me suspect that Gary struck the big outcrop after exit. He likely pitched immediately before impacting and struck as his canopy inflated. Both closing loops were reported to be intact, though this cannot be said for certain as no ""experts"" examined the gear. I saw the canopy and there was no suspect damage. Gary was still completely zipped up in his suit when he was recovered. Knowing that there was a ledge to clear, I think that Gary was nervous and pushed extra hard on exit but lost focus on keeping his body attitude head high in such a way that would allow him to transition into a dive normally rather than too fast. Seeing how hard he pushed I think it is possible that he rotated past head down and lost control and/or orientation of where the ledge was. Gary was an inspiration and mentor to many and is greatly missed."""

According to eye witnesses at landing (3 Belgian jumpers) he got unstable right after the exit, they did not see if he hit the first positive part, so he probably did not get unstable of hitting the cliff in freefall. Then he was in spin and roll for a long time, he could not fix the position, then he pulled, but too late, he struck the ledge at the 1/3rd of the cliff (down at around 250m level) before canopy inflation. After the strike the canopy opened, and he flew down close to the river, landed on a tree already dead."

The clip on the camera had broke before and she was seen gluing it on before the jump.
This would be her 3rd jump of the day, the first 2 being PCA's, and this would be her first handheld.
This is from the exit point co-ordinator Tom, He is not a jumper but is one of the few Menara KL staff really respected by The base jumping organizers. He has seen enough base jumps over the last few years to know what he is really seeing and was the one PCA'ing those that were not comfortable with freefalls.
Tom said he checked her out on top and all looked fine. He asked her twice if she wanted a PCA to ensure she was comfortable with the first hand held she was doing there. She went off not too bad and pitched after half a second. He said as soon as she pitched it looked different than normal. Where he sees a jumpers pitch normally out at maybe 45 degrees, this seemed to be closer to her head and forward. It appeared the bridle did one complete wrap around the camera maybe 2 feet from the pilot chute. He believes she eventually got it free but it was too late.
The slight crosswind that existed, combined with a weak pitch forward, were the contributing factors allowing the bridle to wrap around the GoPro mount.
300ft doesn't give you much time to address a problem-- Buffy fought, cleared the bridle, but ran out of time impacting as the canopy was in the process of reaching line-strech.
If you find yourself at an exit point with a Bender (from Futurama) toy containing ashes, you're about to make a jump with Buffy."

Herbert was an experienced skydiver with 1000+ jumps and a BASE beginner.
We stayed in Lauterbrunnen for some days and this was Herbert's 19th BASE jump and the first jump that day. We chose the Yellow Ocean exit because he still had slightly unstable exits and Yellow Ocean is the best spot to improve the basic skills. When he jumped he went a bit head down but was able to stabilize his position after 3 or 4 seconds. Then he made an obviously unintentional move like a beginning barrel roll to his right hand side but Im not able to say why. Since he fell out of my sight I only could hear but not see the opening.
Eye witnesses from the Air Glacier Heli base told me later he opened very low and close to the wall and had two cliff strikes immediately after opening.
They didnt see any action under the canopy so he must have been knocked unconscious by the first strike. When I found him he was still alive but died in the Interlaken hospital from the severe head injuries and loss of blood.
He had not been wearing a helmet and the medic said with a helmet he might have survived but maybe with brain damages, this is mere speculation. We installed a memorial at the exit also as a reminder to make us think about what we're doing prior to jump."

60m to 80m below the exit of the Dent de Crolles, there is a steep ledge (6m width) one needs to clear with a serious launch. Clément was seen by a basejumper under open canopy flying high near the cliff around 10:30 on Wednesday. He didnt reappear in the evening and the rescue teams started searching by night. Due to rain and mist, he was found 2 days later dead with severe head and neck injuries, on Friday morning around 7:30.
He was in a very steep gorge where no one would normally land, far from the cliff bottom where his camera was found only at 10m of the steep cliff bottom 350 m below the classical exit. The helmet with the chinstrap broken was found a little farther than the camera. A review of the camera memory card showed that no release of video occurred whereas he used to film his jumps. The toggles had not been touched: he either was unable to unstow the toggles, or was unconscious or dead under canopy. A 36 pilot chute was found connected to the canopy.
Whether he slipped approaching the exit due to unstable slope with disintegrated rocks or he had unstable exit without the force necessary to jump safely from this exit, is unknown. He lost his helmet with the camera on the impact and was seen under opened canopy, he landed farther to the south in a steep gorge where he was found two days later."

the count begins and Anton goes off doing a triple pike into a few front flips. At this stage he is at 7-8 secs still in rotation on a 12 sec to impact rock drop.
He comes out at 9-10 secs still facing the wall, turns at about the 11 second mark (this is when the second jumper starts tracking away and we lose sight in video).
He knows he has to pitch to not impact at 12 second mark, he pitches and gets a 180 turning to right...
No time to turn away impacts hard the first time, the canopy turns around a little but is grabbed by either a branch or the rock ledge and this then smashes him in even harder, this is the blow that killed him instantly.
Had Anton survived the impact, he was still hung up on wall for 7 hours as an alpine team tried to rescue him.
Anton either chose to ignore, or did not think of the consequences of leaving very little separation on a big wall."

Tylers mentor student went first, and had an uneventful deployment and landing near the base of the tower. Now the rest of this is speculation based on events from the other jumper. The student believes that Stimson, while rigging his bridle and static line apparatus had his bridle wrapped around one of his lower extremities. upon exiting the bridle pulled tight un-yoyo'ing stimson and extraced his pins and pulled his canopy around the path of the bridle wrap. During this event this caused Stimson's canopy to wrap around his body as he fell to the base of the tower with a canopy wrap situation. There could be two possibilities, either the static line for some reason held and pulled the canopy to its fatal location, or the static line broke due to weight stress, and the pilot chute pulled the canopy around the body during freefall. This is the 5th static line related fatality. Check your rigging, and clear your bridle!"

After the fifth attempt he dissapeared into the tree shadow and impacted about 1/2 a second later onto rocks. Watched in disbelief as I had witnessed him touch and check the pilot chute a thousand times before exit like we all do. Being a bit rounder than average with big solid shoulders, I think his rig has moved far enough up his back when he went into freefall position from standing to put the boc just far enough up his back to be out of reach. He wasnt the most flexible of blokes either. This was his first stowed jump on that rig after two successful hand helds. The rig was not custom made for his dimensions(ie. his roundness/girth).. I think this was a contributing factor .He had over 6000 skydives,very current, and this was to be his 6th BASE jump. I,m wondering if he had his legstraps fully tightened,as this would cause the rig to move upwards with his shoulders when flying a boxed arch and legs spread more so than when standing. Things to learn from this would be. 1.. If doing stowed jumps,be sure the gear is made for your dimensions. 2.. If coming back to the sport after a long break,treat yourself like a student and wear the rig all night and day and practice laying flat and in a flying position deploying your pilot chute. In fact make sure you can get to your pilot chute in ANY position you may find yourself in,but most importantly in the full arch position when the rig has the most likelihood of moving on your body. 3... If any doubt exists,go hand held. He was an excellent skydiver who jumped small rigs and canopies. He was my good mate. I still bereave his passing. Best thing that can happen now is that lessons are learnt from this and in turn helps make our sport safer."

- Jim was an experienced wingsuit base jumper and had jumped this particular wall 5-10 times before. It is not a beginers jump but also is not an excessively positive exit, it is possible to track. Weather and gear were not factors. He had given his ice axe to the photographer to carry down. He was not wearing crampons and there was no ice on the exit, it was solid rock. He was wearing expedition grade boots he had jumped over 20 times before. He was exiting second on a 2-way with the intention of filming. He did not appear to slip as he exited. Photos of the exit taken back from the edge indicate that the exit was too steep and went passed vertical. Contact with the wall occured approx 4 secs after exit. No-one witnessed the jump itself. It goes without saying that conditions are very cold on Baffin Island. You live on rehydrated food and on some days you miss your family and friends more than others. I am an experienced wingsuit jumper and once did something similar - towards the end of an expedition had an overly steep exit that was not caused by slipping. I remember feeling very steep as my expedition boots continued to move a little further forward tipping me slightly past vertical. After a hard arch I had a steep fast exit and a safe flight. It is very hard to believe what happened to Jim. He was very competent and experienced in all respects. All I can think of to take away from this is to suggest that wingsuit jumpers think about and discuss steep exit recovery techniques."

More info from His close friend ""He was a great guy with an abundant enthusiasm for wingsuit flying- but ......he was a beginner pilot who was hanging around all the experienced jumpers. He only had one - two years in the whole sport of basejumping from first basejump to flying big wingsuits. he was a classic example of too much -too soon. I jumped with him alot and his exits were poor- classic head high student exits. I think it is important to differentiate. Lest others think they are experienced. It is easy now for beginners to successfully do a basejump/wingsuit flight and think that just because it was an advaced spot- then they are good. Knowing your real ability is key factor for every jumper- including myself"""

Scott's helmet was still on but once removed by medics it was obvious that it had been knocked out of place and then back into place as evidenced by the huge gash under the helmet. Scott was jumping a skateboard style (Miller Bowl Cut) helmet that did not extend down to cover the ears or back of the head. This helmet style has become quite popular in BASE because they are light, comfortable, and cool, but as this incident illustrates they provide little real protection when you really need it.

It is roughly a 220m (730ft) wall until the talus begins and total height to his planned landing roughly 450m (1500ft). He needed a good exit and extra good flight to make it to over the landing area. He was the first jumper off on the load and had a good exit. According to the others on the load, he did not appear to have much forward speed for the wingsuit he was using and towards the end of the flight he looked like he was flying close to the stall point. He deployed low, maybe 100m short of the planned opening area, and impacted with trees shortly after with his canopy only partially inflated. From the exit point there appeared to be no movement and the decision was made to jump down and see if he needed help. One jumper landed very close and got to him within 10 minutes. He was unable to reach Jimmy as he was high in the tree. There was no movement and no response from him. It is believed Jimmy died on impact from severe spinal damage."

Upon checking with the locals to join the load they were told it's too hot (temperature not bust factor) to go at that point in the year and they recommend not going at all. The two decided to go anyway. Instead of taking a marked trail, Leroy decided (against his friend's better judgement) that they should blaze their own trail as it looked to be shorter to just follow his GPS straight up. After feeling lost for quite some time Leroy's friend decided to stop and turn back. Leroy did not agree and marched away. Leroy did eventually make it to the top. There are three exit points on Notch and the South wall is the only exit point with enough altitude to the talus not to be considered a technical wingsuit jump. The North wall is positive, and the West wall is only 600ft to the talus. Unfortunately, the South exit is not obvious to find and Leroy ended up deciding to jump the West wall. His body was found after many days of searching with clear indications of high speed impact on the talus. This exit point is a technical wingsuit jump and not suited in the least for a first wingsuit-BASE jump. Leroy visited with me just two days before making this final jump and I can say I always found him pleasant to be around.

Mike also looked to be flying slow. Then Mike went out of view. There were no spectators on the road and no one saw Mike's impact. From the way Mike?s body and gear was damaged it appeared as though he had done an emergency pull while still over the rock, impacting on his backside at linestretch. (on a wingsuit BASE jump, initial linestretch will usually put you on your back)."

Gorm and another jumper were on the exit ready to jump, both wearing wingsuits. They knew there was a Southeast wind in the area, but at the exit point there was no wind. Gorm wanted to see his fellow jumper's flight before he made up his mind about where his flight line would be. The other jumper never saw his jump, and there were no other witnesses on the ground. The scenario is just based on what I think happened. We knew Gorm had jumped off and flown a route to the right from exit, then either impacted or landed in a crack. He was missing for about 2 hours before something was located in a snow avalanche from the top of a mountain coming out of a crack. The rescue personnel scanned the area from helicopter when they arrived, and did see some fabric and a shoe sticking up of the snow. Due to the dangerous area, they decided not to take any further action, until the area was stabile. The snow avalanche was huge, and it was still coming down rocks and snow around in the area, also around in the valley. At this point they classified the situation as a body recover, and not a rescue operation, due to the time factor, and how they analyzed the situation. Two friends of his went later in the dark, to recover his body to a safer place, without informing the police, or rescue personnel. Later they got the body down with the police and help from search and rescue. Conclusion I have, and it is only what I think what happened. Gorm chose to fly a line to the right, after watching his friend fly straight out. We know there was Southeast wind, and this has a huge influence for this area. He might have flown proximity, and with this wind condition he would have met great turbulence along the mountainside that MIGHT have taken him out! Most local jumpers have heard about the SE winds in the area, but really do not understand the forces. I have been flying in them and truly recommend no jumping in those conditions."

Ski off of a mountain, do some flips, then pull on release cords that are attached to upward releasing ski bindings in order to jettison the skis and fly away from the wall in the wingsuit and deploy.
Shane did a double back flip in perfect McConkey style. As planned, afterwards, he went to release his skis. This is where the jump went wrong. He was able to release the right ski, but not the left, to make matters worse, the right ski became in-tow on the left.. He remained focused on releasing them by reaching down to that left binding. This put him into a spin/ unstable falling style, that was out of his control and not his concern; Shane was only concerned with reaching that heel piece on his left ski so that he could release it and achieve a snag free deployment. His movements were intentional and deliberate. He succeeded in releasing that left ski off of his boot and then both skis were gone. He immediately transitioned into a perfect flying position; but he was too low. Less than a moment later, he impacted the snow, and died.

The PC was inflated prior to the exit, and the jumper was not really able to throw. It seemed like right after the throw, the PC was blown behind the jumper. The PC was already inflated at the time of exit as he was holding it by the mesh. It was most likely unintentional as the jumper was experienced and new to throw instead of letting go. The container opened really low, he impacted right before complete linestretch, with lines partially out.

On day 5, Suppa went first. The winds were reported to be close to calm, or they were in the wind shadow of a 4-5mph crosswind. Suppa took 1 second delay, stowed, in a flat and stable body position. The opening was a 180 with a half-linetwist, canopy flying towards the cliff. The first cliff strike was hard and the smack was heard clearly by the jumpers up top and below. Suppa was still facing forward and this strike was on his back and possibly back of his head; Suppa was wearing a skydiving helment for this jump. The second stike came after he had come out of the half twist and was head on. The strikes caused large boulders to be dislodged from the cliff and the combination of talus angle and destruction to the canopy caused it to collapse leave Suppa on the talus. The two jumpers above jumped down and landed by him for assistance. One jumper had recently gone through EMT training (a good idea for all of us) and began to assess his friend's situation. Rescue and paramedics were called in but Suppa died during extraction from major trauma. Chad was a well respected federal Wildland Firefighter."

It is a great jump and not actually very dangerous itself, but getting to the exit point and the exit itself is a big mind fuck. Even after my first jump there I landed and I was shaking and I have 1700+ jumps. From what I was told afterwards it was Simon's first repel which would've added to the nerves. The exit is also technical as you can't see over the egde past a few meters and it is quite underhung for the first 50 feet. Nothing too dangerous but again, a big mind fuck as you need to push off quite hard to get clear. For me personally it is a tracking jump and not a wingsuit jump but it is not for me to tell others they can or can't jump. Again simon seemed like a safe and sensible jumper so I did not worry about him at all.
We were not looking up when Simon jumped but immediatley after impact his friend came running over explaining what he had just seen
He said he saw someone tumbleing and then a partial parachute coming out and more tumbling down the wall until the talus. He also said there was no way that who ever it was could have survived, so it must have been fast.
From the exit point my friend told me that when Simon was about to exit he was very nervous and couldn't get his footing in the right position to exit. (its a bit of a shitty exit point for your feet and there is some grass on a slope). When he exited he went off in a head down position with, I think, his right shoulder down,with his opposite leg kicking to get stable, before he disapeared out of view.
When I got to him on the talus he was wrapped in his tangled canopy and dead, with massive multiple injures.
In my view I feel that he exited a little unstable and possibly paniced because of the mind fuck related to the jump. Because of the wingsuit trapping his arms in and also his experience level, I feel he tried to fight the tumbleing all the way down either
1) until impact where the parachute bounced out and he continued to tumble and get wrapped in his canopy until he stopped.
or
2) he tumbled from exit and opened his parachute too late and tumbled down to where he came to rest.
I have a feeling from memory that his pilot chute was still in its pouch which would mean it was senario number 1.
There is not much to do to prevent this type of death except for each and every person to know their own experience levels and not push forward to soon. This is an age old problem that will never go away. Either you make it through that stage of jumping, either uninjured, injured like a lot of people do, or dead which is still pretty rare over all with all the jumps that get made.
I do think that his death has made people realize that this jump is an experienced peoples jump only and hopefully that will keep people away. A similar lesson is learnt from every fatality."

At the exit point we all looked over, deciding on our landing areas etc, winds were gonna be no problem thankfully this morning so we all went ahead and kitted up. I do recall thinking at the time that the powerlines were at a slightly awkward distance for a wingsuit, but had no desire to point out this fact as Gus being an experienced wingsuit pilot and what with me having none and i just had confidence that Gus would make it over them no problem as this was his plan, so who was it for me to offer advice or even make my opinion heard. We decided on an exit plan, all solos and i went last as i wanted to film everyone's exit, the first 4 jumps went fine, all 4-5 secs delays and made it back to the planned landing areas, then Gus launched himself off, from my perspective it looked like a great flight, although i was watching it on my LCD screen, not with my eye, i can't say how long he was in flight for, but as he starting getting nearer to the powerlines i did think to myself damn he's low, then i saw him deploy just he had made it over the lines, from my viewpoint his canopy came out behind the powerlines, but no sooner had his canopy deployed it collapsed on the ground, my cam was fully zoomed in at this point as it was hard to tell if there was movement from his white wingsuit, i turned the cam off and was squinting to see if there was any movement, there wasn't, and i knew he was at least hurt bad. As you can imagine, i didn't wanna jump, but not having the car keys i was stuck at the top, the others all landed far away from Gus, and i decided that i could be first on scene if i just jumped now, i don't even remember the jump, it was just a means to get down quick, i landed next to Gus, but Rich had made it before me as its a long canopy flight. Looking back on the jump, it would seem to me that Gus obviously realised in the last few seconds of his flight that he wasn't gonna make it over the powerlines, but rather than pulling and deploying into the lines, he tried to make it over them eye witness on the ground said his flight was very flat compared to usual body position, which says to me he was trying his best to clear the lines, PC was thrown out the same height as the lines, approx 120-150ft, but as we all know, that simply isn't enough... The paramedics were on scene within 15 mins, but there was nothing they could do. I hope you all take comfort in the fact that it was instant, Gus did not suffer and he did die doing something he loved, in a place he loved."

He had a good track, good delay, reasonable pull altitude. Pilot chute in tow, reached back to pull bridal directly, actively trying to get something out until he disappeared into the trees. Found with canopy out, still neatly folded on the ground beside him, closing loops not broken suggesting pin extraction before impact. Gear was inspected but no obvious cause for a pilot chute in tow was evident. The only thing to note from the gear inspection was that he had a bridal with a wingsuit shrival flap attached. Accounts suggest this shrivel flap was seen tightly bunched up after the jump. It is not known exactly how he had stowed the bridal. It is possible that the bridal was stowed in a way that the shrivel flap snagged during extraction causing it to bunch up and form a solid ball that became wedged somewhere. This scenario might be possible if excess bridal, including the shrivel flap, was tucked under the closing flaps where normally only the last section of bridal between the pin and pouch is tucked. This is only speculation but having a second bridal for non-wingsuit jumps or storing the wingsuit shrivel flap inside the pilot chute where most of the bridal is normally folded could avoid this theoretical scenario."

After pitching he goes into boxman and was waiting for the opening. In this position he fell down into the trees. The container remains closed until impact. He dies immediately. On the next day we checked his base gear and found that the pilot chute was collapsed. The bridle had made a knot around the pilot chute. Our guess is that Oleg took out his pilot chute and before throwing he held on to it for a bit. During this time the bridle was in air and it was ?dancing? and either created a loop around the PC then or while he let go. Suggestion: Don?t hold PC if you pull it ? throw immediately.

The first was from the 3rd valley, this jump was from the 2nd valley. The visibility was excellent, there was a small breeze at the exit point but nil wind down below. The jump is about 4550 feet from exit to landing. It was a 5 way, wingsuit jump. But due to the nature of the exit point, only about 2 jumpers can exit simultaneously. Stevo exitted first, followed by another jumper and then myself with 2 others following. He was in a V1. We flew the left wall out into the valley and then turned a sharp left to follow the wall along to where the 3rd valley comes out (We have flown out of this 3rd valley on 2 other occasions - one being earlier that day). At this point, I was about 80m behind and slightly above. Stevo had planned to fly up into the 3rd valley briefly before coming back out. We were flying close to 90% max flight. Stevo turned left into the 3rd valley briefly, before straightening again and then he started to turn right back out of the 3rd valley. I did not go into the 3rd valley but continued to fly straight. Due to his turn I was now only 40-50m behind and still above. As he continued his right turn it became a hard bank (most likely because he realised he was too far in) to the point that his right arm wing folded under, similiar to when you initiate a barrel roll. With the speed he carried into the turn he most likely would have been getting alot of side-slip as well. Stevo corrected but lost stability whilst trying to maintain his sharp turn. He remained unstable and impacted the far side of the gorge after another 2 sec. At this point I was about 30-40m above and 10m behind. I flew away from the valley, opened, landed and we called a helicopter. Stevo's body was retrieved within 2.5hrs. Stevo was a great friend to those around him and will be sorely missed by the Oz BASE crew and those around the world that met him. He was inspirational, a joker and a great mate."

Unfortunately, we had a fatality here yesterday. Reports are thin, because the jumper was alone. We do have some tourist reports from the overlook. Conditions were very bad, so bad that none of the locals believed this was really a BASE fatality at first, as we all thought it impossible that anyone would have decided to jump in the very strong and extremely turbulent winds. From my initial conversation with the coroner, it appears (I have not examined the gear, so this is going off what the non-jumping medical examiner was able to relay over the phone from my questions) that impact occurred at high speed with a closed container, but with the PC fully deployed. My best guess is that the jump took place in a very high tailwind (weather history shows 32-39 mph winds at the time of the accident) and that the jumper experienced a wind induced bridle entanglement (possible from pitching early with a high tailwind, and getting the PC blown back under the arm/body). Sheriff dispatch reported a call from a jumper just before the jump [as per local protocols] followed within 10 minutes by a call from a spectator who had observed the impact. No jumpers observed the accident, so all my information is 4th hand at this point. I'm hoping to have a look at the gear sometime in the next few days. A report issued by local authorites on 4/12/07 is now saying Yegor was found with the bridle still wrapped around his hand. This is the fifth Perrine Bridge fatality and Twin Falls' sixth BASE fatality overall (the former being from another area bridge). The five Perrine fatalities all appear to be from pilot chute problems that led too late, or no canopy deployments at all."

He'd contacted another jumper before this jump and they discussed various issues including any possible static electricity problems. He'd just taken delivery of a brand new BASE container that had separate cutaway handles for each riser although the reporting jumper says it's not known if this had any bearing on the fatality. The jump was planned for a dry landing but once open Mikhail apparently realized he couldn't make the LZ and he went into the water about a 100-feet (30 meters) from shore. He was then seen struggling for about twenty minutes before being overcome by hypothermia. The water temperature was reported to be 39.2 F (+4 C). Ground crew tried to get to him but could not do so in time. His body was recovered and taken to the hospital where emergency care was provided. Mikhail had a website and it is here:"

While dams have been popular BASE objects for a long time Sean has become the first BASE jumping fatality to occur from one. The weather conditions were good and the winds were 0-2mph across the dam. Hubert jumped first and had a perfect on heading opening. I went second and also had a good opening. Sean had a 90+ degree off heading to the left, but the canopy then apeared to surge left again as it started to fly - into the Dam wall. It was a full body impact, the canopy remained partially inflated, but he fell 80ft+ awkwardly onto some railings. He did not have enough time to react, but he never gave up."

The witness also mentioned Edgar wasn't wearing a jumpsuit or tracking clothes. The second jumper opened and when he looked back he saw that Edgar's canopy had hit the wall and it and Edgar were now falling the rest of the way. This is the fifth fatality to involving flying back to earth with camera. Edgar was a well liked and experienced BASE jumper who's death, I hope, will unfortunately yet mercifully, end the single most disastrous year in BASE jumping's 27-year history. We lost thirteen brothers and sisters to 2006 and that should give us all pause to ponder what we are doing. The true consequences, of course, are visited onto the families of those jumpers, but it should reinforce in all of us to be as careful as possible. I don't know what the true answer is, or how we go about making the sport safer, but I do know we could all slow down a little bit, and we can, and should, temper our bravado around each other and especially around newer and would-be BASE jumpers."

It is not known for sure if he removed the pull up cord prior to jumping. He then did a floater launch that went slightly head low and he pitched at 2.5 seconds. Witnesses on the bridge report his pilot chute looked too small the inference being the pull up cord is still on the pilot chute. Another witness, in the LZ, said the pilot chute was inflated just prior to impact. The bridle was found to be tightly wound around one of Joe's ankles. The container remained closed (although one witness said it opened at the last moment) and when examined the pilot chute was free of any packing aids. Another witness on the bridge, who was not part of Joe's group, said he watched Joe use the pull up cord to stow his pilot chute, but couldn't say if it was left in place as he never saw the pull up cord again. This witness also mentioned he pointed out that Joe had twisted a leg strap while donning his rig and that Joe fixed the twist prior to launching.

Those jumps became the catalyst for the sport later to become BASE jumping. Last year they both came to Bridge Day (2005) and spoke to the assembled jumpers. The recounting of their El Cap experience had us laughing, clapping, and yes, crying a bit too. It was the closing of circle in the history of BASE and I consider myself very lucky to have had the chance to become friends with both men. Up until that Bridge Day neither man had kept up their BASE jumping or skydiving, but that year (2005) Mike Pelkey made a successful jump from the bridge. Brian deferred saying he wasn't ready, and he spent the following year getting ready and dreaming of next year's Bridge Day. Prior to his jump Brian received refresher training from several qualified people. Video shows Brian struggling to move the trapped pilot chute from his chest for 2 full seconds. While Brian did unintentionally perform one backflip shortly after a non-vertical standard (20 degrees forward) launch, he became stable and deployed his pilot chute in adequate time. He did, however, fail to deploy his pilot chute into clean air. Brian deployed his pilot chute into his chest at the 5 second mark where it became trapped against his body until being released at the 7 second point. Brian's parachute began to deploy, but the slider had just started down the lines when impact occurred at 8.5 seconds. I would be remiss in not mentioning what kind of man Brian was ?? he was generous to a fault and as big hearted as they come. Mike Pelkey lost his best friend at Bridge Day 2006 and we lost a gentle man who unconditionally and genuinely loved us all . .

At the last second he obviously realized he couldn't make it and threw his pilot chute, but did not have time to extract anything else as he hit the ledge. He died instantly as was confirmed by the autopsy report. A word about aerials: There was another jumper with Adam who has since penned a heartfelt awakening concerning aerials after they both agreed to do aerials on this jump. The gainer. The truth of it is, at some point this summer, the gainer became my 'crutch' move. I can finally be honest about that. I had always heard about people that struggled to do a flat and stable exit because all they ever did were aerials, I hadn't realized that I had moved in that direction. I was scared and gainers made me feel confident, so that's probably why I saw what I wanted to see when I looked over that ledge. Beyond that, I really thought that I could pull it off. Of course, the true test of a successful jump is not whether you can 'pull it off,' but rather if you can repeat it."

Alone on the tower now Mario climbed outside into a launch position. He then pivoted 180-degrees in order to face the tower and hook up his pilot chute. Then he turned again to face away. However, he turned the wrong way and effectively wrapped the bridle around his lower body and he didn't notice the problem prior to launching. The dynamic shock load of his full body weight hitting the bridle as he fell caused the cordage holding the bridle and pilot chute to the tower to separate prior to opening the container or giving him line stretch. He reacted quickly and fought to clear the bridle, but while the pilot chute did inflate, and did open the container, the parachute itself is fouled around his body and he died immediately on impact."

She did a good launch and a stable face to earth delay before encountering a problem in deploying her stowed pilot chute. Witness reports state she reached for the pilot chute and either missed it or lost her grip - while extracting it from the BOC. One witness stated her last attempt to deploy the pilot chute resulted in it (the pilot chute) getting on her back and hesitating. The final result was an impact with essentially nothing out. Shannon, as evidenced by the outpouring from within the BASE community, was a special person whos zest for life influenced all who came in contact with her. It must also be mentioned that this year's event in Twin Falls saw marginal weather conditions and less jumps made than in previous years, yet there was a serious up-tick in the amount of injuries sustained by jumpers in general. There are some saying this bridge is a cakewalk as far as BASE jumps go - but all well thinking BASE jumpers know better than to apply the word cakewalk to any BASE jump. Note: Shannon has become the 100th BASE jumping fatality since the first one occurred twenty five years ago in 1981."

He had been using it for some time and as most of the jumpers, he had experienced that he had to make some adjustments to his position and technique to get the suit really working. He was experienced big wall jumper and very current on this specific site. The jump in question was his first jump where he really nailed his track from the very first stages of the track. He really had his suit flying and he was motoring towards the LZ. (It must be noted at that point tracking to the landing area was not so common feat on this site). At the same time as he was tracking along the talus he was getting sucked lower and lower and he probably didn't experience normal ground rush as his track was really going at that point. So at the time he started to deploy he maybe didn't notice just exactly how low he was, he was not by any means too low but just low enough that his margin for error was getting thinner. At deployment time he experienced some unstableness in his position, tried to correct that and tumbled, from there he probably tried to gain stability before deploying. He eventually pitched but impacted the talus near line stretch. What must be noted from this fatality is that while the modern flying equipment is making BASE safer it is also is presenting us with new hazards. When going into tracking suits or starting flying wingsuits it must be remembered that you might not experience normal groundrush and you can easily get unintentionally sucked low. Also stability issues during pull time can be very different situations with big inflating clothing."

Earlier that day they had been discovered while preparing to launch from the 56-story Montparnasse tower, the only real skyscraper in Paris. It is then decided to attempt a jump from the Eiffel Tower. Initially the plan called for jumping from the top of tower which is 930-feet. However, tight security made them abort that idea. A decision is then made to attempt the jump from a lower level. The second level (or platform) of the tower is 370-feet and at this point the second jumper elected not to jump. Olov launched and impacted the first level of the tower. This level is 200-feet AGL and 170-feet below where he launched. In modern BASE terms the Eiffel Tower is first jumped by two BASE jumpers in 1984. The following year stuntman/skydiver B.J. Worth made a legal jump for the James Bond film , A View to a Kill.

We planned for him to be the low man and he was to signal me to pull by reaching for his pilot chute and delaying one second. I deployed my canopy as soon as his hand moved toward his pilot chute. My canopy deployed normally and on heading. After I established that I had a good canopy I witnessed Erich with a partially open canopy impact the ground. The spot where he impacted was on a hill about thirty to fifty feet above the base of the tower and 250-ft horizontally away. I landed safely and immediately cutaway my canopy and ran toward him. I found him unconscious and unresponsive. I tried CPR but he did not respond. I then called 911 and emergency services were sent to the scene.

The following is from an eye witness. The jump is witnessed by two British jumpers and two Swiss jumpers. One Brit watching, and videoing, from the exit point, the other three watching from the LZ. This is Duane's first wingsuit BASE jump, and his first jump ever with a leg mounted pilot chute pouch. Prior to this jump Duane prepared by making 50 aircraft and 2 hot air balloon wingsuit skydives. Duane had a good exit and a good flight. Everybody saw him reach for and locate the pilot chute at what the witnesses said is a reasonable altitude. He then kept his hand there and continued in freefall. The speculation is the lack of normal groundrush (like the type he is used to when not wearing a wingsuit) might have fooled him. The Swiss are yelling at him to pull and he finally did so, at what they said is about 30-feet above the ground. The canopy lifted out of the pack tray but is no where near line stretch when he impacted in a full flight position. According to the Swiss there is no fumbling around, or looking for the pilot chute handle - all the witnesses agree on this. He reached and located the pilot chute, but just took to long to deploy it. A hard pull cannot be fully discounted at this time, but all the witnesses believe he just waited too long.

The weather is clear and there's no wind. As usual he started to track from the wall face and out over the talus. Linus is a highly skilled tracker and his previous jump from Labben in June, this year, he made a 38 seconds delay sans wing suit. No one knows exactly what went wrong, but this is what I saw from the landing area. The canopy started to deploy at the lower point of the talus, but he impacted on the talus before the main canopy is fully inflated. He hit the wall twice in his fall and eventually came to rest at a ledge, approximately 150 meters up the talus. Within an hour, the rescue team had located him, dis-entangled his parachute, and declared him dead. Technical examination of the canopy revealed one toggle is released. Linus' injuries and the fact only one toggle is released indicates a possible 180 degree off heading opening and a cliff strike. Linus is a very experienced and skilled big wall jumper. He found his passion for BASE jumping in Romsdal, Norway, where he made his first BASE jump with an American friend in the summer of 1997. His love for BASE jumping drove him to the big walls of Europe where Linus and had some of the best moments of his BASE jumping career. He found comfort in the mountains and Linus is fascinated by the dramatic landscapes of Norway, and especially Trollveggen. He spent a lot of time in Romsdal where he and his Norwegian friends opened up many new launch points. Linus has many good friends in the BASE community. His first years of BASE jumping he shared with his good friend Thor-Alex Kappfjell, whose memory he always kept close to his heart.

After a normal freefall Bill threw out the pilot chute. The pilot chute inflated, went to the end of its bridle and peeled the shrivel flap from the rig. However, the shrivel flap is not connected to the canopy. Speculation is Bill is distracted while putting his rig together and may have passed the Type-12 bridle through the attachment ring on the top of canopy but didn't complete the lark's head knot that would have secured it in place. The bridle had a bar tack on it that could catch in the ring and give the appearance the bridle is correctly attached to the canopy. Parachute Riggers have known for a long time that when you start any job you finish it. If you are distracted, and need to leave the work, you start the procedure over on your return.

His friend believes Kirill encountered a stability problem late in the flight. The friend, along with authorities, inspected Kirill's body and gear at the hospital. Kirill had opened his canopy, the slider is at the links. Both toggles are still stowed. The wing zippers are closed and the swoop cords are still over his fingers. The wing fabric between his legs is torn. His broken neck and one broken leg suggest opening and impact occurred at about the same time. The report intimates failure of the wingsuit material between Kirill's legs caused a stability problem at pull time. By the time Kirill stopped trying to overcome the situation and deploy, it is too late. Kirill is the first BASE jumper to die flying a wingsuit on a BASE jump.
 
 
Update 15th June 2019
Cause Of Death: Impact sub terminal (near exit)
It was not impact. He hooked ground when canopy was fully open.
We heard sound of the opened parachute. Time was not enough for good
fligtht but more than rock drop for that exit.
 
""His broken neck and one broken leg suggest opening and impact
occurred at about the same time.""
I guess he had a bad flight and unfortunately he opened his canopy low.
After opening he hooked ground and broke leg. Leg's
wing was torn in that time. Neck was broken when he fell.
 
""The report intimates failure of the wingsuit material between
            Kirill's legs caused a stability problem at pull time.""

As this is the second BASE fatality here in two weeks the Swiss BASE Association is asking all BASE jumpers to refrain from visiting the area as they iron out problems with authorities and the media.
Update from jumper on the 2 way:
Cause of the accident: stupid plan / not thinking
plan: I do a 5 sec. delay  Wolle wanted to film my opening if there is enough time to catch it on video
jump: I did 5 sec. delay  Wolle tried to film my opening and impacted during his opening (lines completely out of the pocket  canopy open after impact)
.once again: the mistakes are made already before the jump.
doing camera = bad (not perfect) tracking : filming a 5 sec. delay incl. opening @Staubbach is not possible
we had enough experience to know that before!
May be an extra negative effect caused by jumping a camera system from a TV station and not his own helmet (his own helmet was much better  incl. the video quality)
(Bicycle helmet with a camera on the front  not very stable on the head  and a cable to the recorder on the belly)
 I thought this system looks a little bit dangerous  BUT I SAID NOTHING
He is missed everyday.....

Dr. Nikolas (Nik) Hartshorne,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,,2002-08-06,,,,,,Switzerland,BASE Fatality,Earth,Object strike under canopy,"Slick, Slick by Everyday Clothing worn",Unknown,Unknown,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,"180 Offheading, Not enough forward seperation on exit, Not enough separation from object, Unstable exit","Nik had 501 BASE jumps when he launched for this planned 9-10 second delay. Most of his previous BASE jumps had been low ones and he's actively working on his tracking skills. According to the one witness who saw the entire jump Nik launched head down, but looked as if he would recover. However, he deployed before complete stability is achieved.
The canopy opened facing the cliff and Nik is turning it away (using rear risers as the brakes are still set when the canopy is inspected) when he landed on a ledge. At that point he had already turned the canopy 90 degrees away from the wall. The canopy collapsed and Nik fell backwards from the ledge. He impacted a second ledge with his head (this is the fatal injury) and the canopy re-inflated and flew into the wall a third time and hung there a moment. The canopy then dropped beneath him and he fell into it. He fell down the remaining part of the wall (several hundred feet) wrapped in the canopy and hitting the wall 6-8 more times. CPR is performed to no avail.
Nik is a very popular BASE jumper and will be missed. He is also a Medical Examiner who, not only lent his expertise to previous BASE fatality investigations, he also performed the autopsy on singer Kurt Cobain. Nik's death has caused his name to be included into the conspiracy, fans say, surrounds Cobain's suicide."

The following is from a letter I received from Brian's father.
In respect for a father who has lost a son, I'm printing it here just as he wrote it. There is speculation on your list about a rubber band packing error.
I must tell you that there were two official investigations concerning Brian's death. Neither one mentioned a rubber band error theory or even came close to speculating about it. In fact, Brian gave his mother the rubber band that he was using for the packing of the pilot chute just moments before he jumped. He jokingly made a comment to her that leaving the rubber band in the pack job could very well ruin a good day.
What we have are the facts: Brian was using a 38 pilot chute, a 6' ft 9"" in bridle; went stowed for the very first time on his fatal jump; was assigned a 1.5 second delay, was on his 12th BASE jump, and was on a big 8-way coordinated jump at the Perrine when he was killed.
His pilot chute was in tow and opened just point four (.4) seconds before he hit the water.
His canopy was not extracted from his container. He was killed on impact.
The people who have made the speculation comments are people who are feeling guilty about Brian's death and are trying real hard to find a reason for his death that makes them feel less guilty.
Bottom line: Brian should not have been on that load with his obvious inexperience going stowed with a 1.5 second delay with the gear configuration that he was using. The people on that load and Brian's friends who brought him into BASE jumping are the ones who let him down and allowed him to use equipment that was not right for that jump (considering all the complexities of the jump that I have mentioned). I don't guess you would allow my speculation just presented above to be on your list. Therefore, I am asking that you remove the speculation comments about the rubber band packing error from the list as well. The family is very sensitive about this issue. And it is just totally wrong. He was 24 years old.

Here's the story from someone on the load.
We are a pretty big group at the launch point, and I'd just met Jorge and his friends that day and this is the first jump we planned on doing together. The conditions are pretty bad. It is raining and the wind is strong and gusty.
We stayed in the cave near the launch for a pretty long time and waited.
When we had about 30 minutes to an hour of daylight left we went down to the launch point to make a decision.
The conditions are better, but not good. I think if anybody had said, let's go down, everybody would have gone.
But we decided to jump.
The wind is coming from the right, so we agreed on going low enough to be in the wind shadow of the wall, below the turbulence, but high enough to deal with any heading problems.
Jorge jumped last and deployed his canopy higher than all the others.
After opening he flew parallel to the wall until he impacted in the big corner.

No one knows if Terry tried to self rescue himself by jumping from the ledge using his reserve canopy (this is done with success by another jumper several years earlier) or if sometime during the night he simply fell.
Friends say he probably thought rescue was not in the immediate future. And the 52 year old former SAS is the type to take matters into his own hands. Terry is also a movie actor and stuntman.

The following is 2005 information: There is a short film, now making the rounds called Last Stunt concerning Terry's accident that was made in 2002. The film is touring with the Banf Film festival and was recently screened in California. Here's the text of the promo from the film. British stuntman Terry Forrestal arrives in Kjerag in Lysefjorden, one of Norway's greatest fjords. He is going to relax - away from his hectic film work - by BASE jumping from the top of the 1000-metre-high mountain. But one of the jumps goes wrong and a difficult rescue begins. In the film, Terry's sister accuses Norway of bad rescue planning and of running death tourism. This is the story of Terry's last stunt, the promo concludes."

Roger was packed slider-up after jumping the Perrine slider-up all weekend.  Unknown if it was an intentional decision to stay packed slider-up for the Hansen, which is a lower bridge than the Perrine, standing at 350 ft.
Roger opened for a soft landing in knee-deep moving water, unable to make glide to the landing zone, unable to fight the river current.  Unknown if his Perigee P-4 was equipped with a cutaway handle, or if he tried to use the cutaway, but he was found a month later with his rig around his knees."

Petersen died from exposure after spending several hours/the night on the wall where he struck the cliff and became trapped. He had been repeatedly told, by other jumpers, to be more responsive during the canopy opening sequence. He had also been repeatedly advised to apply deeper brake settings to his non-BASE specific canopy in order to avoid its excessive surge and drive. Eyewitnesses claim he had ample room and time to employ commonly practiced evasive maneuvers but he allowed his canopy to fly into the cliff. There is also an inference that the Police/National Parks authorities would not initiate their own rescue effort or let several reasonably equipped jumpers abseil to Peter and extricate him from the cliff. Authorities say it's because the rescue is too dangerous, jumpers say they are motivated by other reasons.
END ORIGINAL
UPDATE
This update comes from a jumper on the load: Torben was under canopy for only a very short time when he hit the wall and he did not have a chance to turn away from the cliff face. This is due to the fact that after about 4 seconds the wall becomes underhung and you open directly beside the wall - hence I doubt if the gear was a huge factor in his death. I along with another person on the jump believe he may have had line twists too.
END UPDATE
The update still reinforces quick decision making and immediate canopy input is a required skill.
Dare I say it may even be more important than 'hucking a gainer'.

The plan was for Sébastien to flip to his belly at that point and track to the left while the jumper above him would head to the right. After the exit, there was more gap between the jumpers than they would have liked for the video so they concentrated on closing it up instead of maxing their forward movement. When it was was time for Sébastien to flip over, and the 2 way to separate, it became apparent that they had not tracked far enough from the wall and were approaching the talus. Reportedly they were 2 seconds to impact. Sébastien immediately pitched and hit the wall during deployment. The second jumper tracked for his life and was able to out track the slope of the talus regaining some altitude and pitched. He opened off heading in line twists from the track and was able to clear them and avoid a wall strike. This jumper had been experimenting with early designs of track pants and wingsuits and before jumping decided to use a new set of pants that was given to him to try out.

Robert Overacker
DAREDEVIL FIFTEEN
In July of 1992 Bob Overacker, a California native who had lived in New Jersey as a young man came to Niagara Falls hoping to drive a jet ski over the falls. His idea was to gain enough speed at the brink to project his jet ski far enough away from the grasp of the churning rapids. He would then release a parachute that he had attached to his life jacket and slowly drift to the rapids below.
When a stunter makes a decision to perform something of this magnitude he usually puts a lot of careful thought and planning into it. Robert Overacker was no different. He had made many calculations and planned his strategy well. However there was one issue he failed to take into consideration.
The Niagara Parks Commission will not agree to such stunts and anyone caught doing so is promptly arrested. Robert Overacker knew about this and he thought that by attempting his ride early in the morning he would avoid the throngs of spectators and thus possible arrest by the Parks Police.
However the one thing that Robert did not take into account was that much of the water is diverted to hydroelectric plants through the night, making navigation difficult due to exposed rocks. Frustrated, Overacker decided to abandon his attempt.for the time being.
In September 1995 Robert Overacker once again returned from California to Niagara Falls with a trailer containing his Kawasaki. On the side of his jet ski were the words save the homeless, a cause that Overacker was dedicating his trip to. On October 1st with the help of some friends, Overackers jet ski was towed to the upper Niagara River near Dufferin Islands.
His friends, including a half brother had positioned themselves at a strategic point where they would be able to videotape the whole event. Robert Overacker was last seen saluting the spectators as his jet ski careened over the brink. Moments later he was spotted in the churning rapids below.
At first it seemed that he had survived the plunge, but the rapids have a strange way of flailing a corpses arms around, often giving the appearance of a person swimming. Robert Overacker was later retrieved from the water, taken to Niagara General Hospital where he was pronounced dead."

The jumper's contention is Lake Powell is legal for sea-plane landings so should be legal for parachute landings as well.
Update: On the afternoon of September 15th, rangers received a cellular phone request for medical assistance for a person with life-threatening injuries who'd fallen from a cliff near the mouth of the Escalante arm of Lake Powell. Upon arrival, they found that Paul Thompson, 51, of Dixon, California, had already expired. Thompson was part of a group of seven BASE jumpers who'd made several parachute jumps from the cliff face just south of the Escalante confluence. Witnesses said that his chute deployed upon jumping, but that Thompson got twisted around and struck the cliff face several times because of the parachute's pendulum effect.

2009-01-30
An updated has been received from a friend of Jason's:
It is true that he was found dead at the bottom of Blues Point Tower in Sydney and that he appeared to be with no one else. There were witnesses who lived in the building who heard him as he fell past.
I was one of the people who inspected his rig at the police station after his death. The police told us that the rig was exactly as they had found it, and it was still tied closed with a chord.
At the time, Jason use to pack his gear, and then tie it closed to stop any premature opening while carrying it to the launch site.
We were also told that one of his shoes had come off and was still on top of the building when he died. On further investigation, it became obvious that he fell from the building prior to setting up for his jump.
Like any of the people who have been killed in the sport, it is a shame and I believe avoidable.
Since this jump there have been more deaths attributed to people forgetting to take off something they've used to tie around they're pilot chute. I personally don't understand the need for this and even less understand why this mistake continues to happen. An email received in 2009 suggest that witnesses interviewed in a 1995 documentary mention that the rig was found at the top of the building and the slip must have occurred while just checking out the exit point. It's inconclusive today whether Jason fell with his rig on and tied shut or without it on."

Update 11th Feb 2023
 
Description:
It happened on mother's day, 1993.
We were jumping a site I found in the mid-80's, an overhanging, 1700' wall, that required a helicopter to access - it was on a true pinnacle in a bend of the Little Colorado, just before it dumps into the Colorado. We made many, many trips there.
Jon had just gotten re-married, and came out after a commercial TV shoot, as I had an extra day with guides, permits, and helicopter, that I couldn't get refunded, so I called a lot of friends who came out.
Jon had a brand-new Vision Systems rig, single canopy system. It had a BOC on it, that Jon had never used that style before. He had a 38"" PC with an 8' bridle as supplied with the rig.
Jon also had, brand new, pink PD 230, never jumped unmodified canopy. I am/was a rigger who built & modified gear, and we discussed doing the typical mods for that timeframe on it - those being moving the inner steering lines in a half cell, a deep brake setting ( or 2 ), a tail pouch with locking stow, and releasable toggle keepers ( some folks wanted that for slider down jumps), among other things.
However, it was brand new, he just got it like a few days before; we discussed if it was Ok to use on this huge wall, without mods, and as one could get terminal, and track, we decided it was OK to jump that day.
Plan was myself taking a 6 sec delay, Jon at least an 8. As we did pin checks, Jon pulled a small amount of fabric out of the pouch, to have plenty to grab on to, and we exited.
The accident jump was video filmed from the ground, and still photos from the top.
Upon my deploying, Jons PC, unbeknownst to him grabbed enough air to accidentally deploy, he was in a dead track, it opened 90 degrees to the right, violently surged, as all skydive canopies do, and ran into me. A cell wrapped over my head, and I was blind, and choking. I was wrapped completely,
My canopy was mostly open; and Jon was hanging beneath me, swinging back & forth (seen on video). the canopy slowed turned, eventually ran into the wall, whereupon it split, nose to tail in the centre, and we started a violent ""helicoptering"", striking the wall repeatedly.
It was by any definition, a freak accident - eliminate any of the things that went wrong - the premature deployment, the off heading, a fraction of a second higher, or lower, or even myself on the bottom ( for that height, I had a highly modified Racer, with a mesh slider, square reserve that would open in about 80-90'), and the incident would have been a fun bar story, instead a horrific tragedy.
By the video we estimated we impacted at 55-60 MPH. Jon Died an hour later of a torn Aorta, I was conscious I am told, but don't remember it after hitting the ground.
The rescue took 8 hours, as were on top of a 400-450' 45-degree talus of very jagged nasty volcanic rocks and I had to be ""basketed"" down.
I was in hospital for weeks, coma, and spent quite a while in a wheelchair, and a walker.
I didn't work for a year."

In his words you feel some thing is going to kill you and you must fight; the turbulent air was sucking him and he fought until he moved sufficiently away from the cliff where air became stable again. Marita was an experienced skydiver with much more than 3000 skydive and had jumped El Capitan before.
She had a good exit and as the helicopter pilot and guy on top of the cliff said on-heading. So they wondered why she was flying into the tube. She flew through the hole part of the tube, and when arriving at the other side of the cliff, they thought OK, now she gets out of it, but no. The parachute made a left turn at the corner of the cliff and flew up against the wall, this happened altogether three times. At the end the chute collapsed and she slid down until final impact.
The jumpers evaluation was: Marita had a line-twist and when the wind from the left is strong enough it turns your on-heading- chute left into the cliff round (tube).
When you come out on the other side you get the same effect there, the wind goes against the wall,ie makes a round left. When you are still working with the twist you have no chance, it turns you against the wall."

UPDATE FROM BASE#229 BELOW
The jump was from a hotel in London (300'). Darren He went without his mentor and took along with him some DZ friends to watch. Method of deployment was Pilot Chute Assist. Using a modified Pursuit 230 in a sky diving rig which had been loaned to him. He exited very head down with the canopy deploying between his legs and opening 180 and surging into the building front. The canopy surged and stalled repeatedly, from studying the video post jump Darren was probably unconscious or killed on the first impact and was declared dead on the scene. He had been advised a number of times to sort his exits out as his previous 3 jumps were all head down . Jumping this Hotel was for the more experienced.

His curved pin is primed half way and he's using a 52-inch BASE pilot chute. After landing, a previous jumper said he watched Robert go somewhat head down and throw his pilot chute early. Robert then towed his inflated pilot chute to impact.
The speculation is he tightened his belly band down (after a final gear check by the jumper who went first) and this put too much tension on the main closing pin. Combined with an early pilot chute throw and the associated lack of snatch force this may have caused the pilot chute in tow. The irony here, according to the first jumper, is they had both recently discussed purchasing Velcro closed BASE containers but the cost was an issue.

He took up BASE jumping late in life after making one legal El Capitan jump back in the early days. He is the oldest person to receive a BASE number (at the time) and had 26 BASE jumps when he is killed.
Dick's last jump is via buddy assist (someone holding his pilot chute) that resulted in line twists. Dick first struck a steel cable hanging by the side of the building before suffering a very hard building strike. In looking at the gear later it appeared one toggle, which Dick had wrapped in tape to form big open loops, had released in the initial strike with the cable adding to the speed of the second impact.
Dick isn't wearing a helmet.
This fatality brought to light the need for BASE body armor, i.e. helmets, and pads and the necessity for a secure toggle system.
Dick's fatality is also the first one on BASE specific gear.
Dick is wearing a Velcro closed BASE rig and all previous BASE fatalities have been on skydiving rigs, either pure or modified for BASE."

The top of the pilot chute and several inches of mesh were exposed. The pilot chute partially inflated before he released it. This tipped him backwards and torqued him as the canopy opened, giving him multiple line twists. He tried to untwist and almost succeeded, but hit the wall not very far above the bottom.
He suffered moderate orthopedic injuries to his lower legs and a gash on his forehead, but what killed him was his camera.
David was a professional photographer and stowed his camera inside his jumpsuit with the lens against his body.
When he hit the wall, the lens ruptured one or more of his internal organs and he bled to death internally before that injury was noticed or diagnosed.
Later investigation revealed that Dave had corresponded with a highly experienced jumper, and had misunderstood that jumper's suggestion about holding a pilot chute with the top outside the hand-hold for faster inflation.
Instead of exposing only the top of the PC, he also exposed mesh, which caused it to inflate before he pitched.
He was unable to clear the resulting line twists before hitting the wall, in part because the Royal Gorge is only about 150 wide at the point of impact.
The Royal Gorge Bridge is first jumped by Don Boyles, using gut gear, in 1975.

I was there at Salto Angel, and I can say nobody saw the entire jump. Considering the trauma Jean-Marc experienced (he died from wounds in his legs and the loss of a lot of blood) I can tell you he hit the wall, for sure.
Jean-Marc is jumping a very small canopy, a skydiving reserve canopy with a attachment point, called the Vega 180. The canopy is packed in a deployment bag. Speculation is he had severe line twists after opening, hit the wall, and then experienced a hard out of control landing in the trees.
Previous to Jean-Marc's leap another jumper, named Catherine, had jumped and also hit the wall. The helicopter (there to ferry jumpers up to the top) mistook Jean-Marc's waves for help as a sign he was all right and went off to rescue Catherine. When it returned Jean-Marc is dead.

Through his wonderful films and boundless enthusiasm he showed the world that fixed object jumping is a repeatable act available for any reasonably experienced parachutist. He published the world's first BASE information with BASE Magazine and also began issuing (in 1981) the sequential BASE Number Award (BASE #### ) we still use today. Carl Boenish, and his wife Jean, are in Norway jumping for the cameras of an American TV show called, That's Incredible. After the shoot is finished Carl decides to make one more jump. He jumps from a new launch point, not the one they had been using all week, and the result is his not clearing an outcropping in freefall. Carl Boenish is the first Trollveggen area fatality.
The following is newer (2002) information reported by a local Norwegian BASE jumper. I knew a man who went up to Stabben with Mr. Boenish the day of his fatality. He is a very skilled climber, and knew every rock up there. He helped Mr. Boenish to the top of Stabben (it's a little difficult to get up there) and found himself a good spot to photograph the jump. After Carl's fatality, he threw the camera down the cliff and later said, I didn't want anyone to see pictures of that jump. He then went down and contacted police. This same climber is later killed in an avalanche not far from the Troll Wall in the early 1990s. When Carl Boenish becomes involved in fixed object jumping he's already considered the premier skydiving photographer of his day. He photographed the early days of RW in Southern California, filmed the aerial portions of the MGM movie, The Gypsy Moths, and left us what still are some of the most breathtaking skydiving movies (he called them Film Poems) ever made. With a friendly and inquisitive personality, including an infectious goof ball laugh that heard once is never forgotten, Carl is loved and respected throughout the skydiving world. Now, however, as fixed object jumping begins to make headlines, usually for spectacular mishaps, Carl begins hearing, You are hurting skydiving, from his longtime friends. Carl lost many friends, Jean Boenish later said, because of fixed object jumping, and he never got over that. In 1987 (three years after his death) the skydiving community posthumously forgave Carl Boenish and bestowed their highest honor on him, the USPA Achievement award.
 
Updated 27th Oct 2024
 
""Hi JD Walker here, I knew Carl intimately, staying with him, jumping several objects with him, and wanted to correct the record on this accounting of losing him.
The accident gear was a Hanbury Velcro rig, with a hand held 52"" Handbury PC, and a 26"" chest mounted lopo hand deployed reserve. The canopy was a new ParaFlite ""Goliath"", 375' 7 cell, UNMODIFED ( he wouldn't let me do a deep brake setting or more modern tail pouch before the trip). Having jumped it myself and seeing Carl use it many times, his canopy had a severe surge upon slider up or down opening - in part responsible for his wall strike and eventual death.
After he died, Jean (his wife, BASE #3) asked me to examine his parachute and sent it to me. I was one of the earliest guys building single container BASE rigs, and am a rigger. It was obvious that the canopy had struck the wall fully inflated, under flight from its damage - there were several broken ""A"" lines, and multiple snag tears in the nose. The tail of the canopy was virtually undamaged. The climber who filmed it shared
with his local climber friends this story to confirm what happened. After a short delay, Carl pitched his PC & suffered a clean 180 and flew into the wall before he could turn. Carl did not die of impact, he died of a severe chest compression from striking a rock outcropping in the chest. Jean has told me the same conclusion. I had the parachute for 40 years, repairing it enough to jump all 4 objects with my friend Jon Bowlin (BFL in Grand Canyon 1993, that I was involved in) in Carl's memory, in late 1984. To honor my/our friend, on the 40th Anniversary of losing him , despite being now legally blind, I jumped that parachute from the Perrine bridge June 7th, 2024 with a lot of planning and help from my close BASE friends. The parachute is now in the custody of the young man I believe will safeguard it until there is a BASE museum and donate it to that cause when the time occurs in the future (probably in Twin Falls). Carl is sacred man to us early BASE jumpers and its important to us all the record is correct, could please adjust the listing to reflect what happened? Thank you so much, JD - Grand Canyon #1, Arizona BASE #1, BASE arrest #1, Naked BASE #3"

The jumpers shook the dry snow out of the canopies prior to packing, but evidently Pauli didn't remove it all. What's left melts inside the packed rig while it sat in a warm room. The jumpers deposit the rigs into the trunk of an old Saab and drive to Stockholm. The temperatures are well below freezing. On deployment Pauli's canopy went to line stretch but is basically a solid block of ice that never inflates.
Update: Pauli did not have his own parachute gear at that time.
He had to borrow one. Unfortunately he borrowed a slow opening Unit system. Because the tower was only 170m a static line jump was planned. The jumpers had to use power scissors to get to the roof.
At that time parachute needed a distance of 150m to fully deploy (Static line much less).
Jari Mynttinen who later died on Troll Wall was the first to go over.
His jump went perfect. Because, it was a static line jump. They used a rope/thread (normal) to connect static line and and the parachute.
Pauli has used loose single knot to connect to the parachute. Others had made douple knots.
At the moment Pauli made the leap, the static line got loose from the parachute.
The connection rope was broken too soon. The static line did not pull/help the pilot chute out of the bag.
The jump became a normal freefall at that very moment.
Since he was using Unit, a slow opening system even on a regular jump, the parachute had no time to open. One second more and he most likely had survived."

Comments from Jimmy's Daughter:
Here are some photos of my dad, I will let you choose which one you would like to use.
Photo 1 and 4 are on top of El Captain in Yosemite, He does have an El Cap number but I don't have that info
photo 2 is at The Royal Gorge Bridge, 1,000 feet bridge in Colorado
photo 3 is the Vincent Thomas bridge in San Pedro, Ca.
He accomplished 2 chute less and many other amazing jumps before his untimely death.
He was featured on an NBC special called ""Daredevils"". Which aired Nov 21, 1980
The Vincent Thomas Bridge jump, this bridge is about 185 feet of clearance to the water below. This jump was
His first chute less jump were he and Bill Parson jumped 1500 feet apart and meet up in mid air, my dad then linked himself with risers (straps) on his arms and used snapped rings to attach to Bill's legs, once linked Bill dropped an extension lowering my dad 20 feet to make a safe landing.
In Oct 1980 he jumped out of a plane and got back into the same plane without using his chute. After he exited the plane, it descended nose first at 125 mph with a chute slowing it down, my dad then maneuvered himself to the plane, climbed back in and he and the pilot landed safely.
He was also featured on ""That's Incredible"" twice
First, he jumped off a ramp being towed at 75 mph across The Pine Valley Creek Bridge near San Diego, Ca the bridge is 450 feet to the valley below
Second, was his 2nd chute less jump where he jump from a plane and a bakery bucket was dropped out of a second plane, he then meet up with the bucket in mid air and linked himself with risers, he released the chute from the bucket and deployed it, landing safely.
He was also on the game show To Tell The truth as the featured contestant. This aired Nov 20, 1980

He rigged up a 30’ ish rope with a wooden disc at the end to hang from the PPG and sit on.
What we believe to have happened is that due to being over water, his depth perception is off and he thought he was higher than he actually was.
He backflipped off the seat and pitched, but due to being lower than expected, he impacted before any sort of extraction.
About him:
Matt was a super rad dude. Always down to jump and not scared to hop a fence if you know what I mean. He had a very positive outlook on life and was a good dude to be at the exit point with. He was confident, but well thought out. I was utterly surprised to hear that this happened. He pushed it, but in a progressive sense more than a kind of looseness. He prepared for the next step before he took it. Our last jump was a sunset jump in Arizona while he was passing through back to Texas, it was perfect and I’ll forever remember the high fives at the end and saying “how fuckin lucky are we to live this life”"

Everything went fine, Eric flew for his first time the Trench-Line. At the landing area we met other jumpers who had rented a helicopter for these days (including the helicopter crew). Actually the plan was to go to the train station to go back to Unterwasser and make another BASE jump but while stashing in the parachutes we got into a conversation with the crew of the helicopter and got a good offer. After the jumpers who had actually rented the helicopter had also agreed, we packed the parachutes and did the necessary paperwork.
During the safety briefing with the pilot, we went through our jump plan. The plan was to do a threeway, jump off just before Chäserrugg and then fly west and following the mountain range. At about the position of the exit Sputnik we wanted to turn in and then fly the well known lines. Eric’s plan was to fly the Trench-Line like the jump in the morning (if it were perfectly possible, otherwise he wanted to go straight to the landing area).
In the beginning after the exit (X1 of my Flysight track) we flew like we did the plan. The third guy of us was a little to fast, so after a short time he was out of range and it was just Eric and I who were flying together.
Along the mountains were some clouds, the rest was in an absolutely perfect view. When we got closer to the mountains (and to the turning point), Eric was flying right (in the direction of the clouds) and was turning left again after a few seconds. For me it was the last time to do the turn as planed so I flew to the left, but i could see for a second from that point of view that Eric had flown to the right again (X2 on my Flysight track, X3 - position where he was found).
Eric was always very careful he checked every thing twice and was always asking everyone for absolutely every detail in this sport. It was always his dream to do Wingsuit-BASE, this was the reason why he was starting Skydiving. He was absolutely focused on his goal, nearly every jump was a training jump, he read all the BASE books and knew the possibility’s and the risks of the sport. For his last flight he was well prepared, so we absolutely can’t understand why he was flying so close along the clouds in the mountains. It was against the plan we arranged and against his own safety rules.
After we decided to do the Heli jump and the crew accepted the deal, Eric was one of the happiest persons in the world. He also said it is the best day in his life. I guess, he was that euphoric, that he lost the altitude awareness on the risk of the clouds and the mountains.
Probably some questions will never get answered. Everyone who knows Eric, knew that he was a really special guy but with his head in the right place.
We lost a very good friend and we will miss you buddy, so now you can fly along the clouds, we’re going to visit you there."

He was jumping from powered hang glider and practiced exit from it week prior to his accident. As was satisfied with practice jump he planned to exit at altitude approximately 400m above the peak. When he exited from hang glider he felt into front flip and did at least one, possibly more. After regaining control and getting his suit into flight he realised that he lost significant altitude and will not be able to make it over the top of the mountain. At this point he was flying against the mountain and went for right turn to escape to Polish side of the mountain where the terrain drops a bit more. He did emergency pull and impacted just after line stretch. Died on impact to the rocky slope of the mountain.
Martin was considered safe and calculated jumper and it was difficult for us to understand why he didn’t make emergency pull right after he recovered from unstable exit and found out that he won’t be able to make it over the top. Two main factors most likely played role at unstable exit one of them being his size and difficulties to clear the glider with physique he had. The other factor might be not having enough experience with jumping off light hang glider where instead of having good kick into flight position he could easily kicked glider behind. Martin also planned this jump long time ago as I remember him talking about it 2 years earlier so maybe his focus at the time was way too much into making this flight happen and he pushed his limits too far. Also illegality of the jump (in the area of National Park is not even allowed to fly hang glider) could push his effort to reach the goal on first attempt. Martin left wife and son behind and is deeply missed by many.

I feel the need to understand how basic errors ended in tragedy. We all make small mistakes, but rarely several in a row. In this situation a few factors such as the weather, excitement, fatigue, and the number of people flying together increased the probability of error.
[On this day, the trio was planning to fly a different line in another part of Switzerland, but were forced to cancel due to high foehn winds there (Foehn is a turbulent south-wind phenomena particular to the Alps). They moved the project to a line on a south-facing slope between Interlaken and Lauterbrunnen.]
The cascade of events begins with a bad spot. They exit the helicopter too far, and too low, to fly their intended line, even though two of the three had already flown the intended line before from a helicopter.
Perhaps due to uncertainty and the immediate realization that they cannot cross a ridgeline to access the intended line, the pace is set at an airspeed which is slower than average for the suits being flown, and at a glide which is somewhat average (possible causes: head high to find a line? Foehn wind? Pre-planned for filming?).
For the first 40 seconds of the flight, a large ridge to their left blocks access to the slope that they intended to fly. During these 40 seconds they are over relatively flat terrain, and their altitude steadily decreases as they continue at slow speed.
As the ridge slowly fades, there are few escape options besides a small pass. They turn left, hoping to find steeper terrain and an access point to the valley in which they intended to land. [At this point they are flying totally unfamiliar terrain, and only want to reach a landing zone somewhere near to that of the original plan.]
After the left turn, the trio encounters even flatter terrain. They are still flying at a low airspeed near max-glide, and therefore have no energy retained with which they could increase their glide performance. At this point they have around three seconds during which time they could in theory deploy their parachutes at an extremely low but survivable altitude. No one does. What follows is the horror of fourteen seconds of max glide, less than five meters from the ground, with basically no hope of passing the grassy fields that extend in front of them, and unable to access the steeper slope beyond.
So why did all three perish together?
One of the three, considered himself to be a specialist of close air-to-air filming, and his process was to fly just a few feet from his subject and focus on him completely, which did not allow him to see much beside the pilot he was following. He realized the severity of the situation only a few seconds before impact, too late to react. The third pilot was higher, and a little further behind, but he also was maintaining a close focus, filming the other two, and realized the situation only a moment before his two film subjects impacted, probably too late to deploy or change his flight path. He impacted just a few meters beyond the first two.
Several errors and missed decisions were necessary for them to arrive at this point, because the original bad spot did not make for a guaranteed tragedy. Many of us have made spotting errors while skydiving or BASE jumping, and in the high mountains distance and scale can be difficult to assess.
After exit, the standout mistakes are:
1. Undeniably slow airspeed, from the start. The lead pilot sets a pace that is slow, and a glide that is flat – near the max possible. This creates a total lack of potential for glide angle adjustment [they left themselves no margin].
2. The foehn wind which forced them to move locations may have been very light, but present.
3. They could have landed anywhere they wanted before making that fatal left turn into unfamiliar terrain. It was not a reluctance to land in trees that caused them to not pull earlier. [They did not want to land “out”, probably].
4. They made the left turn through the col at low altitude and without being at all familiar with the terrain, with no escape routes available as a plan B. [They hoped that it would be steep – it was not.]
5. After arriving in the col and seeing the terribly flat terrain and shitty situation ahead of them, no one deploys their parachutes. They may have been injured but probably would have lived if they had deployed in these first few seconds after the turn. No one attempts an “emergency pull” – not even in the very last seconds when it becomes clear that disaster is upon them.
As with most accidents, this was an accumulation of errors, and removing even one error from the situation could have improved the outcome. How can we minimize these errors?
There are always new answers, but here are some guidelines that I apply to any situation in which I am flying my wingsuit below a safe opening altitude. I must emphasize that any time I am flying my wingsuit near to terrain at an altitude that is unsafe to open, all of the following points become crucial. Everyone needs to recognize their own safe opening altitude, and then consider themselves to be proximity flying whenever they are below it. We are not only talking about a “mowing the lawn” type of flying.
Before Exiting:
- A physical warm-up: this is essential for performance flying, and to prepare for possible hard landings.
- Knowledge of the area: landmarks such as towns, peaks, and hazards such as power lines.
- Reconnaissance: either on foot, or by paraglider, speed-wing, airplane, etc. Carefully evaluate the landings, hazards such as power lines, and any technical flying sections.
- If exiting from an aircraft, my minimum is 500m clearance over terrain. Cost is not an issue, even at 30 EUR per minute; For a few more Euros of heli-time and altitude, Dan, Brian, and Ludo would still be here.
- Make a Plan B, and plan C! Visualize possible problems and brief each the team on possible solutions.
It is unthinkable to fly a committed line without an in-depth preliminary analysis. For the heli-drops that I did with this same team the days before, we were over-prepared. In some cases I have spent two days in front of the computer calculating glide paths, inspecting terrain using photos and google earth to identify hazards and optimize our line. Two days of ground work… not to mention the preparation for the actual flight. It is only at this price that we can calmly and confidently approach such a dangerous activity.
Our three friends were forced to change plans the morning of the jump due to the wind, and were definitely not prepared for what they encountered, or they never would have committed to flying low over terrain with a mandatory 2.9 glide. [Even a slight head-wind severely decreases l/d].
Guidelines for Flight:
- Speed! Always more speed!
- The pilot must know exactly the angle of every part of every slope he or she intends to fly over.
- You must continually evaluate the terrain in front of you, and you must be proficient at the process of calculating your glide in real time. There are well-known basic techniques to analyze your glide path (such as by aligning three points in line of sight and seeing if you are gaining or losing altitude on the target).
- Be ready to deploy immediately, at any moment. When the shit hits the fan, things almost never improve.
Any time I am flying below a safe opening altitude, whether I am low over something while in transit or proximity flying, it is mandatory that I have an immediate YES to a few simple questions:
- Do I have enough speed?
- Do I have enough glide?
- Do I have an escape route? (this could be UP, if I am flying over steep terrain)
A “maybe“, is a NO!
A NO means immediate deployment. It is always better to emergency pull, even if it means crashing without a fully open parachute, than it is to impact face first with nothing out. Impact is the reality of BASE jumping. The moment that you exit, the countdown to impact begins. We can only stop it by deploying our parachute – nothing more, nothing less. It is always better to deploy late, than never.
As Proximity Flying is becoming commonplace, the ground has begun to appear less dangerous to us. Yet it remains deadly. Our discipline is a sport which, like all sports, requires preparation. Everyone has seen athletes in other sports visualize their line: the alpine skier physically visualizes every turn of a course that he has already memorized, an acrobatic pilot puppets his hand movements for his entire routine before beginning it. And yet wingsuit pilots regularly launch themselves into a line without any of these preparations. An essential part of our warm-up should be an exact visualization of our line.
In this accident, when we add a dose of euphoria from the amazing flights in the days before, a hint of fatigue from the same previous flights, and a few stressful minor errors, we arrive at unexpected and irrational reactions, even for seasoned and experienced flyers like Dan, Brian, and Ludo. No one knows how one will react in their place, and it is pointless to imagine it. The purpose of this writing is to recognize and avoid the process of making errors in sequence.
And then there is the problem of hope. Hope that we will pass that ledge, hope that we will catch a small bubble of lifting air, hope that we’re wrong that we are about to die. It is this hope that can delay our actions in a delicate situation. Because to jump from a cliff, one must be optimistic and self-confident, and this cocktail often blinds us to the reality of a rotten situation, which only worsens with each passing second, with hope quickly running out. And maybe none of us would have done better – hence the desire to stop this type of situation as soon as possible, ideally before the jump, with a solid preparation.
This tragedy, in my opinion, was not the result of proximity flying. It highlights the complex process and the preliminary steps that are mandatory to have a scenic wingsuit flight in the mountains, of which we only see a few moments of in the videos.
Stay humble in the sky. Remember that we are only human. These three were great, and I will never forget them.
Be free and happy,

No one knows how one will react in their place, and it is pointless to imagine it. The purpose of this writing is to recognize and avoid the process of making errors in sequence.
And then there is the problem of hope. Hope that we will pass that ledge, hope that we will catch a small bubble of lifting air, hope that we’re wrong that we are about to die. It is this hope that can delay our actions in a delicate situation. Because to jump from a cliff, one must be optimistic and self-confident, and this cocktail often blinds us to the reality of a rotten situation, which only worsens with each passing second, with hope quickly running out. And maybe none of us would have done better – hence the desire to stop this type of situation as soon as possible, ideally before the jump, with a solid preparation.
This tragedy, in my opinion, was not the result of proximity flying. It highlights the complex process and the preliminary steps that are mandatory to have a scenic wingsuit flight in the mountains, of which we only see a few moments of in the videos.
Stay humble in the sky. Remember that we are only human. These three were great, and I will never forget them.
Be free and happy,

Before the course could start late that afternoon Gary went up to ground launch his skydiving canopy. On his second launch attempt he had his accident when the canopy he was using collapsed due to it failing to inflate correctly and he fell 30m the the ledge below the launch site. He died while on the ledge, with another BASE jumper who had climbed down to help him.



 
 
He was very current at skydiving, having just won two gold medals at the World POPS (Parachutists Over Phorty Society) competions at Reggio Emilia, Italy, the week before going to Lysebotn.
He had completed the course in the classroom, jumps from the pendulator and inspecting the landing area and out landing areas.
The weather was not ideal for novices, but was forecast to be better the next day. Gary watched many experienced jumpers landing.
Late in the day Gary and a friend went up to Eagle's Nest to ground launch their non-BASE canopies. Nobody saw what actually happened. His friend couldn't see over the edge, but knew there was no canopy in the air. Observers at the bottom could see an accident had happened, so called the rescue service. It is presumed that his canopy wasn't inflated properly from the ground launch.
There were four of us from NZ who went to Stavanger from the World POPS meet. Two whuffos and two jumpers who were doing the FBJC."

Richard Heaton,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,,2008-02-06,,,,,,United States of America,BASE Related Fatality,Span,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,"Richard was making his 3rd BASE jump, and his first at this site. He had been travelling all day, and arrived in the evening, after dark. He jumped sometime after 11:17pm on the night of Wednesday, February 6th. Conditions were good early in the evening, although that night we got several inches of snow and had high winds. It's not clear what the jumping conditions were at the time of the jump, but that doesn't appear to be an issue, because he probably landed without incident.
Temperatures were below freezing that night, and Richard was wearing jeans, sneakers and a relatively normal jacket. His new jumping boots were found in his hotel room, in a bag. His stash bag was also left in his hotel room, likely by accident. No flashlight was found, nor was any survival gear found. His telephone still has not been located (although the phone records were pulled by the Sheriff's office, which is how we know he made his last call to a friend at 11:17pm).
Never having jumped this site, it is unlikely that Richard knew the trail to climb out. He apparently began hiking up the canyon wall well away from the normal exit trail, and became lost. He then likely became progressively disoriented, confused and hypothermic. He was found without his rig, coat, shirt and one shoe, all of which he had apparently removed and discarded at different points. It is likely that he wandered in the canyon for several hours before succumbing to the elements. His body was recovered in the mid afternoon today (Friday the 8th). At least one other jumper had made two jumps today without noticing any sign of him."

His plan was to jump from the paraglider and fly his wingsuit over a small hill above the normal landing area. He got his suit flying as normal within a couple of seconds, but after making a turn towards the hill to set up for the pass he didn't have enough altitude to clear the hill safely. He deployed early, and had line stretch and probably 65% canopy inflation before 'landing'. We were at the scene within minutes and he was in a rescue helicopter within about an hour, but died of internal bleeding a few hours later."

Ralph had commented to friends he would be jumping from Mt Rundle, Canada but failed to return. It is thought he was either killed during the jump or died later from injures received. Given the remoteness of the location, search and rescue efforts were unable to find his body. Ralph was a quiet unassuming guy. Only when prodded would you know he was a member of the UK Special Forces, climbed in the Himalayas, sailed across the Atlantic solo alongside completing multi endurance events. ' friends state Ralph was well equipped for this particular jump and had very advanced outdoor skills'"
