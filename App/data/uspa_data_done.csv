While the free fall segment proceeded without issues, instability arose during the pull time, leading to a dive. The jumper initiated the deployment of the pilot chute at the planned altitude of 5000 feet. However, failure to collapse the body/wingsuit resulted in numerous line twists during the opening sequence. Despite the canopy remaining straight and stable, attempts to resolve the malfunction were unsuccessful by the planned decision altitude of 2500 feet. Consequently, the jumper executed a cutaway and deployed the reserve handle, which extracted and inflated without complications. Upon landing, improper flaring for the reserve's descent rate led to a hard impact on the right palm, near the base of the thumb. Although sore and swollen, the jumper retained mobility in the thumb without severe pain.;In conclusion, a review of the incident footage and discussions with seasoned wingsuit pilots revealed critical insights into the sequence of events. Fixating on the chest-mounted altimeter during the pull sequence initiated an unplanned dive, emphasizing the importance of maintaining stability and situational awareness during deployment.

Horseshoe malfunctions can be particularly dangerous. No two situations are alike, and they are nearly impossible to simulate on the ground for training purposes. For these reasons, avoidance is the best defense. Careful packing procedures, maintaining your equipment, and deploying the main canopy in a stable, face-to-earth body position can help eliminate the chance of encountering a horseshoe malfunction in the first place. Because there is a chance the main parachute could deploy during or as a result of the reserve activation, a cutaway might be the best response in some situations. In this case, the main and reserve opened into a side-by-side formation. The jumper decided to land under the two parachutes rather than release the main and descend under the reserve, probably because the two canopies were initially flying stable. However, at a low altitude the two canopies formed a down-plane, which may have occurred because the jumper attempted to steer one of the canopies. Investigators did not report whether the brakes on either canopy were released. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 lists general guidelines for dealing with dual deployments. For a side-by-side configuration, it states the following: 4. Stable side-by-side (choose one procedure): a. Side-by-side procedure 1: If both canopies are flying without interference or possibility of entanglement and altitude permits: (1) Disconnect the RSL [reserve static line]. (2) Cut away the main and steer the reserve to a normal landing. b. Side-by-side procedure 2: Land both canopies. (1) Release the brakes of the dominant canopy (larger and more overhead) and steer gently with the toggles or leave the brakes stowed and steer by pulling on the rear risers. (2) Land without flaring and perform a parachute landing fall. 5. Down-plane or pinwheel a. Disconnect the reserve static line if altitude permits. b.

The skydiver had made three jumps at this drop zone approximately five months prior. Observers on the ground noted the skydiver performing several maneuvers and entering a landing pattern at a normal altitude, executing a predictable downwind, base, and final approach. However, upon overshooting the intended target and landing on blacktop, the skydiver flared at approximately 20 feet, raising only the right arm while keeping the left arm at waist level. The landing resulted in the left leg bearing the initial impact, followed by the right leg with the ankle canted. The skydiver was subsequently hospitalized with a dislocated right ankle, requiring surgical intervention and stabilization bracing.;The incident involving an experienced skydiver underscores the significance of transitioning safely to new gear and wing loadings. Despite the skydiver's experience within a short timeframe and the limited use of the new gear, the higher wing loading of 1.39 posed significant challenges, particularly given the skydiver's unfamiliarity with this new wing loading at the drop zone. The decision to turn final at a higher altitude without adjusting the glide path exacerbated the situation, resulting in a high flare over blacktop.

The instructor managed to dock with the student to stabilize them and intended to deploy the parachute at approximately 5,500 feet. However, upon docking, the student began to flail and panic, leading to a two-out, side-by-side parachute deployment. In a state of confusion, the student activated the single-handle cutaway/reserve system (S.O.S.). This resulted in releasing the main parachute, but the right side riser became entangled with the reserve chute. Consequently, the student landed at a construction site under a partially inflated main and reserve parachute. The impact caused an open compound fracture to the tibia and fibula and a fractured heel on the other leg. The equipment was discovered with both main risers detached from the container. The S.O.S. handle was wholly activated and several feet from the jumper. The main parachute's suspension lines from the right riser group were entwined with the reserve parachute's suspension lines, just above the reserve risers.;The Category D1 student's panic, following an attempt by the instructor to stabilize a slow spin, led to a complicated two-out scenario and entanglement of the main and reserve parachutes. Landing under partially inflated parachutes at a construction site, the student sustained severe leg injuries. This situation highlights the need for thorough training in emergency procedures, the importance of a skydiver's ability to remain calm under pressure, and the potential consequences of equipment entanglement.

Roughly 15 seconds post-deployment, which initially seemed normal, the RDS slider began to flap violently, eventually detaching from the two rear riser rings. Once freed, the rear part of the slider moved up the lines beyond the jumper's reach due to its aggressive flapping. This situation made the jumper conclude that landing with the slider in such an unstable position was unsafe. Consequently, the jumper initiated a cutaway at about 2,300 feet, followed by a successful reserve deployment, resulting in a safe landing under the reserve parachute.;This incident, involving a skydiver's main parachute deployment issues after filming a tandem skydive, gave insights into equipment maintenance and operational anomalies. The skydiver's decision to cut away at approximately 2,300 feet due to the violent flapping of the RDS slider, which had detached from the rear riser rings, was precipitated by unusual behavior following the recent replacement of the pilot chute's kill line about 10 jumps prior. The jumper observed a partially inflated pilot chute in half of these jumps, suggesting a link between the pilot chute's behavior and the subsequent slider malfunction.;44.08898812923216;Yes;No;No;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

Opening on the short side of the spot, the skydiver proceeded with post-deployment adjustments, including removing and stowing the slider and adjusting the harness, while scanning for other canopies. They noticed a yellow canopy below, already in the downwind part of the landing pattern, and a green canopy to the west of the main hangar, approximately at the same altitude. Observing multiple people near the pea pit, the skydiver changed their landing approach from the main hangar area to the pea pit, anticipating a social gathering.;This incident highlights the importance of situational awareness and the complexities involved in canopy navigation and landing strategies. Despite cautious adjustments after deployment and a landing strategy shift due to ground activities, the skydiver's collision underscores the unpredictable and dynamic nature of skydiving. The skydiver's admission of possibly not seeing the other canopy due to its position—behind and below to the right during their base leg—and the additional distraction of focusing on canopy flight and altitude, compounded by the setting sun obstructing their view, brings to light the intricate challenges jumpers face in maintaining awareness of their surroundings. This scenario accentuates the critical need for skydivers to continuously scan all quadrants for other canopies, especially during crucial phases of flight like base turns and final approaches. It also suggests the necessity for implementing more robust strategies for enhancing visibility and communication among jumpers, such as clear landing patterns and high-visibility gear, to mitigate the risk of collisions.

This was their third jump of the day. Following an uneventful freefall and break-off at around 5,000 feet, the coach observed that the less experienced jumper had two fully open canopies in a stable side-by-side formation, likely around 4,000 feet. Shortly after noticing the dual deployment, the coach saw a partial release of the main canopy, leading to an unstable configuration alternating between erratic flight and downplane. No corrective actions appeared to be taken by the jumper. The coach also recorded the incident until the jumper impacted the ground near a road east of the airport. Immediately, several individuals, including the coach, rushed to assist. The coach, who was an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), assessed the jumper's condition until emergency services arrived. The jumper was conscious and could move all limbs, although they might have briefly lost consciousness upon impact. They were transported to a local emergency room with non-life-threatening injuries and are expected to recover fully.;The coach's video of the two-canopy incident revealed that initially, the jumper was under two fully inflated, side-by-side canopies, with the reserve freebag entangled in the main pilot chute and bridle, but no other entanglement. The video later showed a partial release of the main canopy, causing erratic flight and spinning. The jumper remained in this unstable state, an intermittent downplane of a fully-inflated reserve and a partially-inflated main, until impacting near a road east of the airport. At the scene, the Safety & Training Advisor (S&TA) observed the partially extracted cutaway handle that remained hanging from the cables just a few inches below the pocket, with the left riser released post-impact, though it was unclear whether this was due to the impact or actions by ground personnel. An examination by a Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner (DPRE) and a report from the injured jumper are pending. It's speculated that the jumper, having encountered a problem with the main parachute, initiated their emergency procedures (EPs) but performed an incomplete cutaway before deploying their reserve. It appears that the jumper never thought to return to the cutaway handle to complete his cutaway after the reserve deployment.;2.435593347782911;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

The freefall proceeded smoothly until the group unexpectedly tumbled at the planned break-off altitude, instead of executing a clean separation. One of the jumpers' audible altimeters indicated they deployed their parachute at 1,440 feet. Two of the four experienced skydivers had their Automatic Activation Devices (AADs) engage due to deploying their main parachutes too low. One of these jumpers managed to safely land with both canopies (main and reserve) deployed side by side, avoiding injury. The other jumper chose to release their main canopy and landed without harm using their reserve. Among the group, one jumper had over 40 years of experience in the sport, while another also had a considerable amount of experience. They were equipped with visual analog altimeters, and at least one had an audible altimeter as well.;In conclusion, the incident involving the four-way RW group underscores the importance of maintaining situational awareness and adhering to break-off altitudes during group skydives. Despite the extensive experience of the jumpers, the unexpected tumble at the critical altitude of 4,000 feet AGL demonstrates how quickly situations can become perilous in skydiving. The activation of two AADs due to low-altitude main parachute deployments highlights the significance of altitude awareness and the value of having reliable safety equipment like audible altimeters and AADs. The safe outcomes for the jumpers, particularly the skillful handling of a two-canopy-out situation and a successful cutaway, are commendable.

The exit and initial freefall were stable. The student was highly aware, and initially performed the dive-flow precisely as practiced. For the first two flips, the student checked his altitude as practiced on the ground before receiving permission to continue with additional instability maneuvers. The student's continued flips created separation from his instructor. As the student and instructor reached the 6,000-foot altitude where all training indicated ""no more maneuvers"", the student performed an additional flip, which took him below his planned deployment altitude. At this point, the student regained altitude awareness and attempted to deploy his main parachute. However, he was unable to locate the pilot chute handle, and tumbled while struggling to find it. He regained stability at roughly 2,000 feet and attempted to execute his emergency procedures, however his AAD fired before he could find his reserve handle.";All briefings (EPs, dive flow, canopy flight planning) on the ground were uneventful. The student had received a 1-on-1 briefing with his instructor and had also watched the pertinent USPA dive flow video before the jump. The student had done a Category D skydive the day prior and had logged 40 minutes of Level 1 tunnel time. During all prior skydives, the student was exemplary in all aspects of performance. All of this may have led the instructor to become a bit complacent regarding minimizing instructor-student separation during the skydive. Because of this separation, the instructor was unable to reach the student to stabilize him and assist in deploying the parachute without going below his own hard-deck. The instructor deployed uneventfully at 3,500 feet while the student continued in freefall.

He was able to release his brakes, and then used the rear risers to steer in order to avoid outstretching his arms. However, the choking became so severe that the jumper eventually let go of the risers and used his arms to hold the chest strap down away from his throat. This prevented him from steering using any means other than harness input. He performed what he described as a 180-degree harness turn close to the ground to avoid hitting trees, landing with a PLF.

After a normal freefall and canopy descent, the jumper flew toward the designated landing area. As he approached the landing area, rather than flying a smooth pattern, he made some last-minute sudden turns which placed him over the tree line of the beach. The manuevers greatly increased his rate of descent. Before he could clear the tree line, his parachute struck a 25-meter tree at high speed. The parachute was stopped abruptly by the tree, while the jumper's body swung down and forward in a pendulum arc. At the apex of the pendulum, the parachute broke free from the tree and the jumper fell the remaining distance to the ground, impacting on his back.;The briefing for this drop zone included instructions to fly a predictable pattern, as well as a prohibition against flying over the beach's tree line.

She traveled approximately half a mile, bypassing the airport and several safe landing zones, including the designated landing area. Her trajectory led her into power lines adjacent to a busy highway, half a mile from the intended landing spot. The contact with the power lines caused a surge at the airport, triggering breakers and damaging parts of the reserve parachute. Miraculously, the student was not electrocuted. She landed on the road beside the sidewalk. A local skydiver from the drop zone, who is also a military nurse, was the first to reach her and assess her condition. While her injuries seemed minor at the scene, she was quickly attended to by fire department medics and transported to a local trauma center. There, she was treated for a severely sprained ankle and a potential minor concussion, as her helmet had been dislodged during the reserve parachute's deployment.

He was wearing a helmet-mounted video camera to take point-of-view footage of the jump. The weather conditions were favorable, with clear skies, a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit and ground winds of 5 to 10 mph.  The freefall portion of the skydive was uneventful, and the jumper opened his canopy—a small, high-performance wing with a removable slider—at approximately 3,500 feet. Both point of-view and outside video footage showed that the canopy opened at an average speed and on heading. However, the jumper’s point-of-view video shows that the left rear ring of the slider was detached. (The video does not make clear whether it was never hooked up or became detached during what appeared to be a standard opening sequence.) As the slider came down to the bottom of the risers, the left rear ring stayed up at the cascades, which caused a slow left turn. Investigators are unsure whether the jumper noticed the turn or the detached ring, but the video showed that he focused on removing the slider rather than countering the turn. The jumper left both brakes stowed while he tried to remove the slider, but he had difficulties grabbing it because it was flopping around. After about 25 seconds, he was finally able to remove it by reaching around the front, by which time he was approximately 1,350 feet above the ground. Just as the jumper removed the slider, he brushed against the right toggle, knocking it free of the keeper. With the left brake still stowed, his parachute began to rapidly spin to the left. For a split second, the jumper lowered his hands (possibly because he was considering cutting away) but then brought them back up to his rear risers. He attempted to stop the spin by pulling on the right riser, but this slowed his decent only minimally. This corresponds with what a witness on the ground observed: The jumper flying normally for about 25 seconds, “something black” floating away from the jumper, then a rapid spin. In just a few seconds, the jumper made a total of seven very fast revolutions before striking the ground in a cornfield about a half mile north of the drop zone. A search party found him unresponsive and without a pulse about 15 minutes later. They called emergency medical services, who pronounced him dead at the scene.;A post-mortem toxicology report by the local medical examiner found that at the time of the incident, this jumper had a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.204g/ml. This indicates that the jumper was extremely intoxicated at the time of his death. This level of alcohol concentration is characterized by impaired motor coordination, slowed reflexes, reduced ability to process information and make sound judgments, dizziness, stumbling, nausea and potential blackouts.;13.588819758668045;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;2.0;No;done

At the time of the jump, the temperature was 80 degrees Fahrenheit with 14 mph ground winds in the landing area. Before boarding the aircraft, he received a thorough drop zone briefing, which included standing in the landing area and monitoring the winds. The discussion included potential obstacles and hazards and instructions to perform a right-hand pattern south of the runway before turning to land to the east. The jumper exited a Cessna 182 at an unreported altitude and had an uneventful freefall and initial canopy flight. He held south of the runway as directed but did not fly a recognizable landing pattern and was also too close to the landing area to execute one as briefed. When he turned to land, he was too high to make the landing area with a flight path that was taking him past the its east end. Apparently, he realized this and went into deep brakes—one witness described it as a “classic accuracy approach”—to sink his canopy into the landing area. Then, at approximately 250 feet, he began sashaying his canopy in a likely attempt to shorten the final leg of his descent. During these maneuvers under the depressurized, braked canopy, he experienced turbulence that caused the end cells to collapse on the left side. When they reinflated, he was in a hard left turn and on a direct path into large bushes. He then made a hard right turn toward the landing area, likely to avoid landing in those obstacles. The turn was too low to recover to level flight, and he made hard impact with the ground. Emergency medical personnel declared him dead at the scene.;This jumper had not jumped for a significant amount of time and was jumping into a new area, the stress of which may have led him to overcompensate and try to “play it safe” by staying close to the intended landing spot. However, the worst place to be during a landing pattern is directly above where you want to land. Jumpers should plan an appropriate pattern according to the conditions and fly the plan. Jumpers should resist the urge to make in-flight modifications unless conditions change. Jumpers should practice and be proficient at flying their canopies at slow speeds for emergency situations and should learn how these techniques affect their canopy’s handling characteristics. This jumper used deep brakes to sink his canopy into the landing area, which can be safe and effective under the right conditions. However, this technique is not appropriate in turbulent conditions because it slows the forward speed and depressurizes the canopy, making it more susceptible to collapse, as happened in this case. In almost every situation, making a hard turn to avoid obstacles is more dangerous than landing on or in the obstacles. This is why Skydivers Information Manual Section 4-A lists the first priority for landing as “land with the wing level and flying in a straight line.” Although landing in a clear, open area is also a priority, it is a much lower one. Had the jumper continued in a straight line of flight after the collapse, even with the inevitable bush landing, he would have undoubtedly fared better. Jumpers must remember it is far better to hit an obstacle at full flight than it is to turn and hit the ground at twice the speed.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done

Following an uneventful exit and successful execution of her circle of awareness and practice handle touches, the instructor released the student. Shortly afterward, the student experienced instability for an unknown reason and lost altitude awareness. She then tumbled until the automatic activation device initiated her reserve parachute deployment at approximately 900 feet. Eyewitnesses noted a smooth reserve parachute deployment, with the canopy fully open approximately 100 feet above 200-foot-tall trees. The student made no evident attempts to perform a canopy controllability check and descended into the trees under the reserve. The instructor landed near the forest's edge and was the first to arrive at the scene, where he found the student conscious and alert on the ground. Minutes later, a registered nurse arrived, escorted by an instructor who had witnessed the parachute deployment and brief reserve flight. The student recounted her actions, mentioning that she had released her brakes and attempted to flare as she approached the trees. She reported successfully landing in a tall pine tree and holding onto the trunk until she lost her grip and fell to the ground with the reserve underneath her. Shortly afterward, emergency medical services arrived and airlifted the student to the hospital. Her family later received the news that she had succumbed to internal bleeding from a leg injury while at the hospital.;Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 4-D discusses freefall procedures and states that the most important task is altitude awareness. All jumpers—including students—should pull at their preplanned altitudes and must never sacrifice altitude for stability.

The student reportedly exhibited strong aptitude during pre-jump practice sessions and demonstrated a high level of retention of the first-jump course materials, scoring 93% on the test and receiving retraining for the deficiency. The student was using a rig that had two bottom-of-container-mounted main-deployment handles: a standard one on the right side and an “instructor handle” on the left. The skies were clear with a temperature of 85 degrees Fahrenheit and 5-10 mph ground winds. The initial freefall portion of the skydive was uneventful. While in freefall, the instructor pointed out the location of the drop zone to the student, who couldn’t locate it at first. When the instructor pointed out the DZ again, the student nodded her head, presumably indicating that she recognized it. Afterward, the student seemed preoccupied with determining her orientation in relation to the drop zone and stopped monitoring her altitude. At around 6,100 feet AGL, the instructor signaled for the student to check her altimeter, but she failed to respond. At approximately 4,700 feet, the instructor, who was on the student’s left side, flew over her burble to access her main deployment handle on the right side but lost grips at 4,200 feet. At 3,000 feet, the instructor was able to take a grip on the student’s left forearm and pulled himself in to assist. At 2,400 feet, the instructor pulled the instructor handle and promptly dropped his grip. This opened the pilot-chute pouch, but since the pilot chute wasn’t thrown into clean air, it did not deploy immediately. The pilot chute began inflating but danced around in the student’s burble, which allowed it to entangle with the bridle and prevented it from fully inflating once it did clear the burble. Because the pilot chute was strangled by the bridle, it did not create enough force to immediately pull the main closing pin. At around 1,600 feet, the student reached for her main deployment handle, not realizing that it was already released and that she had a pilot chute in tow. Although she was at a low altitude and still in freefall, the student did not initiate her emergency procedures, and later inspection showed that both the cutaway and reserve handles were still in their pockets. At approximately 800 feet AGL, the instructor performed a wave-off and deployed his own main parachute. Simultaneously his automatic activation device fired, triggering the reserve parachute deployment. The instructor was able to land safely under two parachutes in a side-by-side configuration. At around 1,000 feet, the student’s AAD cut the reserve closing loop. However, the main began to deploy at the same time and hindered the reserve inflation. The student landed hard under two partially inflated canopies, with the main parachute’s slider still at the top of the lines and the reserve slider only 25% down the lines. She died instantly from the impact.;On this jump, the student’s designated deployment altitude was 5,500 feet. The Skydivers Information Manual repeatedly states that altitude awareness is a jumper’s number-one priority. Students should concentrate on important tasks in freefall and reserve orientating themselves to the drop zone once they are under the canopy. Even during student jumps when an instructor is present, skydivers are responsible for saving their own lives. Although an instructor may attempt to assist, it is a student skydiver’s responsibility to deploy their main parachute or perform emergency procedures when necessary. In addition, SIM Section 4-A states that jumpers who are unable to locate or pull the main deployment handle should make two efforts at most before performing emergency procedures. Instructors should never allow themselves to go below their minimum deployment altitude (2,500 feet), even if they are attempting to assist a student. It is safer for both the instructor and student for the instructor to deploy their own parachute, which can also signal the student that they must deploy theirs.;0.5568399724271493;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

The ground temperature was 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and there were 10 mph winds in the landing area. Witnesses observed a smooth exit. The instructor—who held his tandem rating for more than six years and was reportedly an active instructor—was using a hand-mounted video camera. The footage showed an uneventful freefall. At 3,800 feet AGL, the tandem instructor deployed the drogue release to deploy the main canopy but encountered a bag-lock malfunction. The video footage showed that the instructor immediately prepared to initiate emergency procedures, simultaneously putting one hand on the cutaway handle and the other on the reserve handle. However, he pulled the reserve handle 1.5 seconds before the cutaway handle, which released the reserve freebag from the container while the main canopy was still attached. The deploying reserve briefly entangled with the malfunctioning main canopy, but the entanglement cleared as the main canopy released. However, the reserve opened with a line-over malfunction, which likely occurred during the brief entanglement. The pair immediately went into a spinning turn. The instructor unsuccessfully struggled to clear the line-over for the rest of the canopy flight, and the pair landed in a sharp turn. The hard impact killed the instructor. The student was severely injured but is expected to make a complete recovery.;The Basic Safety Requirements in Section 2-1 of the Skydiver’s Information Manual Section mandate a minimum deployment altitude of 5,000 feet for tandem skydives. This instructor deployed at approximately 3,800 feet, 1,200 feet lower than the minimum. The SIM describes the recommended procedure for dealing with partial malfunctions in Section 5-1.E and emphasizes the importance of cutting away the main parachute before deploying the reserve. If the instructor had pulled the cutaway handle first, the reserve parachute would have likely deployed and inflated in clean air. This instructor was highly experienced and reportedly current on practicing emergency procedures, but the stress of having a high-speed malfunction at a low altitude may have overwhelmed him, causing him to panic and pull the handles in the wrong order. The BSRs stipulate the 5,000-foot tandem-opening altitude so that the instructor has sufficient time to handle a malfunction following deployment. Even if the instructor pulled the handles in the wrong order, opening at 5,000 feet would have provided roughly 30 extra seconds—even with the canopy spinning—to try to solve the problem. The BSRs are requirements for a reason. Every jumper, no matter how experienced or current, must remember this.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;Yes;done

The temperature was 80 degrees Fahrenheit with 5- to 19-mph ground winds. Other jumpers on the load stated that she seemed nervous on the ride to altitude but showed no signs of medical distress and that her exit and deployment seemed normal. A witness on the ground observed the jumper under a fully functional canopy at approximately 1,000 feet but said that she did not appear to be steering. A later gear inspection revealed that the jumper had released her toggles and stowed her slider and the rest of the equipment was in proper working order. When the jumper reached approximately 500 feet, the witness could see that she did not have her hands in the toggles and that her head was slumped over. The witness saw no further movement, but outside video footage showed that she lifted her left arm about 45 degrees prior to reaching the ground. A witness described the movement as erratic and uncharacteristic of a jumper preparing for landing. The jumper suffered massive trauma during the hard landing, possibly severing her spine at her neck. When first responders arrived from the drop zone, the jumper was not breathing and had no pulse. They started CPR, which they continued until emergency medical services arrived and pronounced her dead at the scene.;The circumstances of this incident point strongly toward the jumper suffering a medical emergency after deployment, but autopsy results are not available to confirm this. Local authorities believe that the opening shock may have released a blood clot from her ankle injury, which may have caused a stroke. Whether or not this was the cause, this tragic incident underscores the importance of comprehensive and honest communication between skydivers and medical professionals. Patients should inform medical staff about the unique stressors of skydiving, such as the g-forces during canopy deployment, pressure changes and heightened anxiety, when asking them to provide recommendations about returning to the sport. This information is crucial for medical staff to correctly diagnose and treat injuries, prevent potential complications and provide appropriate advice about when it is safe to return to skydiving.;5.174238294710588;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done

Exit and initial canopy descent were uneventful, and the jumper then set up to swoop a tight area, rather than setting up for the formal, free and clear, normal landing area at the dropzone. The jumper executed a high-performance turn in excess of 450 degrees on a line either too low or too deep to clear the obstacles in his path. He struck the roof of a hanger, followed by a parked C-182, followed by pavement, where he was tended to by first responders before being transported to a local hospital.;This jumper was uncurrent, performing his first jump back at the start of the season. Instead of making a conservative approach, he decided to execute an extremely high performance turn (believed to be an 810) at a high wing loading (~3.0), into a tight area, swooping a line with an excess of fixed objects to avoid (hangar, tent, parked airplane, followed by fence and fire pit). Though it is against DZ policy, the jumper had swooped this line successfully in the past, though while extremely current. This time, his lack of currency combined with a lack of available outs for the chosen line put the jumper into a corner he could not get out of. Witnesses believe the jumper was either slightly low or slightly too deep for where he intended to roll out, a mistake he would have been less likely to make and more likely to recognize and compensate for earlier were he more current.

Climb-out, front-float launch, freefall, and track-off were uneventful. The jumper deployed his main pilot chute in a stable position at 3150 feet. His main canopy opened by approximately 2500 feet with a half-twist but without spinning or diving. The reserve pilot chute deployed without activation by the skydiver at about 2450 feet and rose into the main parachute. The freebag was extracted in front of the main parachute risers. Before the jumper recognized the freebag and could attempt to grab it, the reserve parachute inflated to the right of the main canopy, flew to left, and then at least one of the reserve lines tangled with one or both of the main risers at about 1890 feet and the main oriented into a downplane. As the reserve swung back around, the jumper's left arm became trapped between the main and reserve risers, but he was able to extract it shortly thereafter. He pulled the main cutaway handle at about 1700 feet, but neither main riser released. He could see a tangled line from the reserve in the area of the 3 ring system on the riser(s), but attempts to pull the lines loose did not succeed immediately. Successive attempts to clear the snag resulted in the left main riser releasing at about 1280 feet, leaving the right riser 3 ring system tangled with a reserve C or D line, preventing it from releasing. The line had snagged the terminal riser ring preventing it first from pulling through the harness ring, and later, once pulled through the harness ring, could not release the riser ring from the line itself due to the line tension. At this point, the reserve was in a downplane orientation followed by a partially-inflated main. The jumper struggled with lines and riser to release the main, and the entanglement was finally released at about 1000 feet. The reserve was briefly in a diving line twist, but the jumper recovered it to a flyable orientation by about 850 feet. He landed safely off the dropzone.;"This skydiver has a habit of conducting a complete gear check prior to boarding the plane for each skydive. He does not recall the gear check for this jump revealing any issues. Video by one of the other skydivers on the jump confirms the reserve flap was in place during the entire skydive. The AAD was submitted to Advanced Aerospace Designs for data analysis and the results showed that the AAD was set to activate 150 feet above normal activation altitude, and was also set in Tandem mode. Because normal Tandem activation altitude is approximately 2450 feet and an additional 150 was added, the unit activated at approximately 2600 feet, during the opening snivel of the main canopy. Following discussions online and at the DZ regarding activation altitudes for AADs and sniveling reserves, this skydiver had set the activation altitude to +150 several years ago. He did not deliberately change the AAD to Tandem mode; does not recall accessing the setup menu of the AAD since changing the activation mode which could have resulted in an inadvertent Tandem setting; and did not notice if the AAD displayed T +150 prior to the jump. While the majority of his jumps are instructor jumps with higher deployment altitudes, several fun jumps in recent months were at deployment altitudes of approximately 3000 feet with canopy snivels resulting in fully-open main parachutes lower than what occurred on this jump without concurrent AAD activation. He cannot explain how or when the AAD was switched to Tandem mode. If the display of the AAD was operating correctly, he overlooked the T +150 during his preboarding gear check.";12.331478186046176;Yes;No;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;No;Yes;No;3.0;No;done

His setup was slightly higher than normal, leading him to make a more-aggressive-than-usual turn onto final, believing it would put him in proper position for landing. Upon completion of his turn, he noticed he was low and still diving. He went immediately and briefly to rears, then made a last-second attempt to stab out on toggles. He didn't have enough altitude remaining for the bail-out maneuver to be effective. The jumper was in a half-braked position when he impacted the ground. The canopy continued to fly for another 30 feet after the initial impact, pulling his body along with it. Once he came to a stop, he gave the spectators a thumbs-up indicating that he was okay. However, he didn't get up after that, and the spectators called for on-site medical evaluation. The jumper did not require further medical treatment and was able to walk it off with only minor injuries sustained: scrapes and bruises to the legs, a sore ankle, and general soreness in his legs, left shoulder and back.;This incident resulted from a combination of complacency, lack of knowledge about his canopy's flight characteristics, and poor decision-making. The jumper had the skills and experience to fly a pattern with a better setup. He did not need to turn as aggressively as he did to keep from overshooting the landing area. He started the turn too low for the type and degree of turn he used. The jumper attempted to bail out with rears first instead of going immediately to toggles.

At approximately 5500 feet, a jumper on the right-side bench near the front of the nearly-full plane witnessed the skydiver get up, open the door, and set up to exit on his left foot with his right knee down, the open door to his left. No handle check was seen during this process. Within two seconds of the jumper setting up in the door, the jumper's pilot chute had escaped and exited the aircraft. This was noticed by the rest of the jumpers on the load, who immediately began yelling for the skydiver to exit. The pilot chute quickly extracted the deployment bag and lines, which also began to escape the aircraft. Instead of following his gear out the door, the skydiver attempted to grab the deploying main and sat down against the rear bulkhead on the pilot's side of the plane. His attempt to contain the canopy was unsuccessful, and the main deployed into the slipstream and over the tail of the aircraft. At this point, the skydiver was forcibly pulled out of the aircraft. He struck the fuselage and then the tail, visibly damaging the front side of the tail. Though the pilot was able to maintain control of the aircraft, there was a period of franticness in the cabin and some jumpers chose to exit the plane without direction from the pilot. The witness was able to communicate what had happened to the pilot, who then set up and flew another pass over the field so that the rest of the jumpers could exit. The pilot was able to land the empty plane without incident.

However, as her foot slid across the ground, it caught the left side of his deflated canopy and pulled him off his feet. Upon impact with the ground, the affected jumper experienced immediate pain in his left shoulder, and was unable to move his arm forward or to the side. The wingsuiter assisted him in collecting his equipment and getting back to the packing area, where he was evaluated by other jumpers who noted swelling in his left shoulder area. The jumper took 800 mg of Ibuprofen and iced his shoulder. He went for X-rays and a CT scan after the pain did not dissipate. The scans revealed a minimally displaced fracture of the left scapula (shoulder blade), and the jumper was prescribed a sling and an orthopedic consultation.;"Both the affected jumper and the wingsuiter are judged by others to be safety conscious skydivers who had attended Safety Day the previous week. The person reporting the incident believes that the wingsuiter was sliding her foot because she flared a bit low, and that it was her foot slide - directly related, in the reporter's mind, with the timing of her flare - which caused the incident. However, skydivers often slide parts of one or both feet on the ground in order to bleed off some of the speed of landing, and this should be accounted for by any jumper on the ground making a decision to move or not to move out of the way. While the wingsuit skydiver may have been able to choose a clear lane which was not as close to the affected jumper, or used harness input to increase the margin between them, the affected jumper also could have moved himself - and his canopy - further out of her way as she approached him. It takes two to have a collision, but only one to avoid it; and the skydive isn't over until everyone is back in the hangar.";3.335751926007521;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;2.0;No;done

He flew a good canopy to the ground. At approximately 800-1000 feet he started a turn. He tried to recover the canopy but was too low. His first impact was against a building. The canopy still had power which caused him to continue to fly and hit the ground and tumble extensively. The jumper sustained a broken leg, 3 broken ribs, and an orbital fracture. He is expected to recover fully.;This jumper had progressed rapidly, accumulating over 1200 jumps though just entering his third year in the sport. The jumper was inexperienced under his new-to-him 67 Airwolf. The incident was a result of the combination of new, small canopy and flying over obstacles under 1000 feet, which minimized his outs when he attempted to recover from his low turn. While making a high-pull can speed up the learning of a new wing, jumpers should strongly consider increasing their turn altitudes and making less aggressive turns to landing until they have become familiar with how the parachute performs close to the ground. Further, USPA recommends a minimum canopy size of 135 square feet for skydivers with an exit weight of 170 pounds and 750-1000 jumps, At only 1200 jumps, flying a 67-square-foot cross-braced wing shows a pattern of aggressive downsizing.

Unable to flare fully due to having only one hand in both toggles, the jumper landed fast downwind in a plowed dirt field and tumbled several times, breaking his neck before coming to a stop.;"Upon reflection, the jumper saw several things that he could have done differently which may have resulted in a different outcome; though he believes he made the best decisions he could with the information he had at the time. For instance, landing from a braked approach instead of trying to flare with only one hand from full flight would have resulted in less forward speed on landing, which may have reduced the severity of his injury. While it was not an option on this skydive because he was underneath a 60-way, deploying the reserve higher gives more time to find a safe landing area, notice the wind change, and adjust the landing pattern accordingly to land into the wind, again resulting in a slower and more manageable ground speed. It also gives time for the jumper to make practice flares so that they know how their reserve will respond during the landing - whether they are using one or both hands.";37.83753336600645;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;Yes;No;60.0;No;done

When transitioning between digital and analog altimeters, it is a good idea to wear both until the skydiver has grown used to the function of the new device. Also, on high-stress jumps (for example demos, night jumps, and those in the AFFIRC), skydivers should use only equipment with which they are highly familiar.;;Yes;No;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

The pack-job for this jump had been completed 63 days prior to use.;It is important to maintain altitude awareness during malfunctions to ensure that EPs are performed no lower than a jumper's decision altitude. When the canopy is spinning, it is even more important to perform EPs promptly to avoid the additional dangers of remaining with a spinning main. If the main parachute is not there, square, and controllable, jumpers must perform their emergency procedures high enough for the reserve to fully inflate, to manage any deployment issues (such as line twists) with the reserve, and find (and get to) a safe place to land. Additional altitude can be used to regain a level of calmness and focus after dealing with the malfunction, and to perform practice flares, which may improve the landing. While this jumper did make an additional attempt to clear the twists after his main started spinning (USPA recommends that you don't delay, cut away from spinning malfunctions), he still implemented his EPs 1000 feet higher than the minimum recommended decision altitude for his license and as a result, was able to steer his reserve to a clear open area and focus well enough to perform a proper PLF on landing.;2.447844219205301;Yes;No;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;;No;done

At that time, he earned his A license using the four-page A-License Proficiency Card and not the ex-military-focused Military Transition Card. On this jump, he exited a Twin Otter at an unreported altitude for his second jump of the day. Skies were clear, the ground temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit and there were 4-8 mph winds in the landing area.   The jumper was flying a canopy loaded at 1.06:1 and was the last to land from the load. He flew the correct left-hand landing pattern but was too high on his final leg to make the landing area. Although he would have overshot the landing area, he could have continued his flight path and landed in a clear area in an adjacent field. Instead, he initiated a three-quarter-braked, left-hand turn at approximately 100 feet AGL. He stayed in that turn—completing nearly 360 degrees of rotation—until impact. Drop zone staff immediately responded to the scene and called emergency medical services. The jumper was still breathing and had a pulse when EMS arrived, but he passed away shortly afterward.;Instead of focusing on his landing priorities (landing with a level wing into an open area, flaring at least halfway and preparing to perform a parachute landing fall), this jumper focused on making his intended landing area and made a large turn to do so. Jumpers can appropriately use braked turns at low altitudes, as half-braked flight reduces descent rate and forward speed, diminishes the recovery arc of a diving canopy and decreases the flight-cycle duration. But even with a braked turn, jumpers must stop the turn before landing, level the wing and flare at an appropriate height. In this instance, the canopy pilot seemed more worried about where he would land than how he would land. Though this jumper had 170 total jumps, he had only 35 under a ram-air parachute, and he had not been jumping frequently. Many of the habits formed while jumping round parachutes don't apply to square parachute flight, and it’s possible that this jumper reverted back to his old training. USPA developed a Military Transition Card to help ex-military jumpers focus on areas that may need particular attention, such as canopy flight, when switching to civilian jumping. It may have benefitted this jumper if the drop zone had opted to use this ex-military-specific training tool when this jumper received his A license.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

The canopy opened fully but in line twists. Later review of the video footage showed that the jumper cleared the line twists quickly. However, the canopy had a step-through, a malfunction caused by the container passing between the risers during packing (the container gets flipped through the risers) or during landing (the jumper steps through the risers), which causes the risers or lines to wrap around one another. After discovering the step-through, the jumper did not perform a controllability check or cut away, opting instead to use the rear risers to steer the canopy without releasing the toggles. Witnesses stated that the parachute began to spiral at approximately landing-pattern altitude. The video showed that at approximately 800 feet, the jumper released the right toggle (likely accidentally), which caused the parachute to spin. The jumper spent the remainder of the flight trying to unstow the left toggle. The spiraling continued until the jumper made hard impact with the ground. Responders almost immediately initiated CPR, which they continued until emergency medical services arrived about 20 minutes later and declared the jumper dead.;A step-through is a very common malfunction but one that can be eliminated almost entirely by performing a line check before packing. If this jumper had performed a continuity check by separating the line groups and walking up the lines from container to canopy, checking to ensure that there were no twists, this entire incident could have been avoided before he even got on the plane. Landing a canopy with a step-through adds risk to that landing, and the brake-release scenario this jumper encountered is not unusual. Jumpers should make a plan for encountering various malfunctions and decide which, if any, they will attempt to land with. While making this plan, they should account for how their canopy flight could be affected and whether they can negotiate a busy landing pattern. Making that decision under a malfunctioning canopy when adrenaline is pumping is not wise. Had this jumper performed a canopy-control check and decided to cut away above his decision altitude, he would almost certainly have survived. The jumper also seems to have fixated on releasing his left toggle to regain straight-and-level flight but ran out of time before reaching the ground. If he had instead applied right-riser input to level his wing (essentially putting his canopy into a braked configuration), he may have had a rough but survivable landing. Still, performing a thorough gear check before every jump and catching problems before they occur is always preferable.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

On the second day and sixth jump of his trip, before the canopy course started, he exited a Twin Otter at 5,000 feet and deployed his canopy immediately, intending to practice a high-performance landing. The ground temperature was 75 degrees Fahrenheit, with 5 mph winds in the landing area. Witnesses reported that the exit, deployment and initial canopy flight were uneventful. When approaching the ground, he performed a 270-degree high-performance landing but did not recover from the turn with enough altitude to land safely. Several witness statements described a hard landing, one which knocked the helmet off his head. One witness estimated that the jumper hit the ground at 70 miles per hour and at an approximately 30-degree angle. Emergency responders declared him dead at the scene of the incident.;This jumper likely felt a lot of internal pressure to perform, since more experienced jumpers were watching. The desire to perform well in the upcoming canopy course and the simple joy of being back in the air after a four-month break were also probable contributing factors. No matter how experienced a jumper is with high-performance landings, they need to start high and turn high until they dial in their approach. When jumping at a new location or after taking a sabbatical from jumping, this slow, methodical approach becomes even more critical. Jumpers must recognize, consider and mitigate these mental factors in order to make wise decisions that help ensure a safe landing. “Landing expectancy” is an aviation term that describes how pilots may assume that the landing they are currently making will end successfully because of previous successes. This bias often causes them to overlook signs that it will not be successful this time. Skydivers can make the same mistake. Regardless of one’s experience or proficiency, jumpers need to have acceptable performance benchmarks and apply those to every jump. Without setting and properly using these benchmarks, it is impossible to know when to abort a high-performance landing. Skydiver’s Information Manual section 5-3.b recommends that jumpers with this jumper’s exit weight and experience jump a canopy no smaller than 135 square feet. This jumper was using a 90-square-foot canopy. With 934 jumps in 7 years (an average of 133 jumps a year), this jumper's 2.1:1 wing loading was extremely aggressive. A lighter wing loading would have been more forgiving and allowed the jumper to learn how to get the best performance from the canopy with less risk to his life.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;;No;done

It was the jumper’s fourth jump at this location. The ground temperature was 72 degrees Fahrenheit with 5 mph winds in the landing area. Witnesses reported that the exit, deployment and initial canopy flight were uneventful. During the attempted landing, the jumper turned extremely low and struck the swoop pond at approximately a 45-degree angle. Once the jumper came to a complete stop, he immediately stood up but then fell over into the pond. Witnesses immediately extracted him from the pond, but he was unresponsive. Emergency medical personnel declared him dead at the scene. Although autopsy results were not available at the time of writing this report, the jumper’s near-immediate incapacitation after the hard impact is consistent with internal bleeding and/or blunt force trauma.;High-performance landings require a jumper to make quick adjustments on the fly. Like any landing, the jumper should plan the approach and turn before the jump. Knowing the exact locations over the ground and altitudes they should target to get them to their setup point can help reduce this workload. A jumper must recognize when their approach and landing parameters deviate from expectations and learn to make the decision to abort. This is a critical decision and can be challenging. Landing expectancy—the anticipatory belief that conditions are not as threatening as they are and that the approach is sure to terminate with a safe landing— has contributed to many airplane crashes in which the pilot could have initiated a go-around. Canopy pilots are also subject to this landing expectancy. This jumper was described as “low” when he initiated the turn, indicating that he either did not properly establish setup procedures or ignored the deviance from those established parameters. The latter is a key indicator of landing expectancy, but because this was the jumper's fourth jump at this location, both likely contributed to the outcome. No matter how experienced a jumper is with high-performance landings, they need to start high and turn high until they dial in their approach. This cautious approach also gives them time to build a good sight picture, especially in a new location. The stresses related to an upcoming competition, a new location, the desire to “look good” in front of onlookers (many who may be of higher experience) are considerations and mental factors that must be realized, considered and mitigated in order to ensure wise decisions are made to ensure a safe landing.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

The temperature was 80 degrees Fahrenheit on the ground, with 5 mph winds in the landing area. After the jumper deployed his canopy, the video showed him tightening his leg straps. At this point, the canopy began to turn to the left, and the video showed that he compensated for this turn by applying right-riser inputs. As the jumper made a 90-degree turn to induce speed for landing—reportedly the jumper’s usual routine—the video showed that he rolled left again. A witness stated that the jumper’s setup and turn seemed normal, but after the canopy planed out, it suddenly rolled left, diving the jumper into the ground. The jumper was unresponsive after the hard landing. Emergency medical services arrived on the scene and attended to the jumper’s injuries, but he was declared dead shortly after arriving at the hospital.;This jumper reportedly had a history of asking others how to stop his leg straps from loosening during his jumps, a problem that remained unresolved. On this jump, he apparently asymmetrically adjusted his leg straps by over-tightening the left one after deployment, which caused a left turn. In this case, the jumper handled the maladjusted leg straps fairly well during routine canopy flight and probably expected that he could make a similar correction during landing. Reportedly, this jumper usually completed his turns for landings high, with the canopy planing out about 15 to 20 feet above the ground. On this jump, his turn setup and execution were similar to his previous performances. However, because he induced speed for landing, he did not have enough time to react when his canopy dove toward the ground. This jumper should have considered how making a speed-inducing landing maneuver would reduce his response time for correcting the turn caused by the misadjusted leg straps, although a better option would have been to refrain from using gear that was not performing correctly. This incident is another example of landing expectancy: The jumper did not recognize that conditions were as threatening as they were and anticipated a safe landing. Safe landing requires much more than knowing and meeting your setup locations and altitudes or knowing when to bail out of a turn. Jumpers must perform a canopy-control check after opening to determine whether their equipment is in good working order, and if it is not, they must adjust the rest of their canopy flight accordingly.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

Proper procedures and cloud clearance requirements were followed during the skydive. At 5,500 feet, the student waved off and deployed their pilot chute for the main canopy. In the instructor video, the student's canopy fully inflated within 50 to 100 feet of vertical fall and 1 second after their pilot chute was deployed. The jumpers head snapped forward into their chest and back and stunned them. The leg straps and chest strap jerked them upwards, and several other airborne skydivers heard “the snap of their end cells hitting each other.” The student did not lose consciousness. They recovered after approximately 5 seconds, gained control of their canopy, performed a satisfactory control check, and continued their prescribed canopy skills for the skydive. They felt immediate pain in their neck, shoulders, and back from the whiplash effect. They landed with no further difficulties.;;0.4537763691951887;Yes;Yes;No;student;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

She had an uneventful successful Cat B freefall from 12,500 feet. She was given the pull signal a little early as the spot got a little far south and east of the airport. She responded and pulled for herself. After opening she was seen flying a completely open and square canopy. She flew continuously towards town, she was seen making controlled inputs and maintained a heading of approximately 315 degrees (airport was just slightly to her right at 335 degrees) but she never turned her heading away from town. She was not seen following any radio communication. She covered approximately 2.6 nautical miles from opening to the landing site. Most of the ground she travelled over was open fields with limited hazards until she got over town. When she wasn't turning towards the Airport the DZ's ground support truck left the airport and drove down main street following the path the jumper was taking. Once she was over town she continued on a heading parallel to main street slightly north at approximately 100 feet she was witnessed making a right 90 towards the north (some open dirt parking lots) followed quickly by a left 180 (towards nothing open). She was seen with a level straight flying canopy, she tried to pick her feet up over a power line (approximately 16' off the ground ). She struck the highest center power line with her hamstrings right above the leg strap padding. Multiple witnesses reported a large flash, they saw her tense up, the canopy kept flying above her head and she landed in a junk yard area falling to the ground about 25' south of the power line. The canopy draped over bushes next to her in its full size. She was conscious and alert when people got to her, she was only complaining of pain in her thighs. Helmet was on and secure, googles were on in good condition not fogged, and the radio was in the on position with the proper volume. The jump suit melted to the back of her legs exposing thermal burns to this area. She was transported by ground ambulance to the closest Hospital, and later transferred to a regional burn center for further care. Canopy was found with both toggles unstowed and were seen in her hands at time of contact, with no knots in the control lines and no damage to the canopy.;;0.0555095376943537;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

Just at this time, the tandem instructor's left hand made an unusual motion and then he attempted to flare with the rear risers. The rear riser flare had no effect due to the unfortunate position of the jumpers in the canopy's recovery arc and a lack of altitude remaining for any effect to take place, resulting in an extremely hard impact of both jumpers into the ground. 911 was called immediately and both jumpers were transported to the hospital.

The freefall portion of the jump was uneventful. The student deployed at the planned altitude of 5,000 feet and held a heading to the north-northwest. The upper wind conditions were believed to be relatively strong at the time of the jump, so the coach had briefed the student before the jump to hold into the wind for the first portion of the canopy flight. However, the upper winds were actually considerably weaker than the coach had anticipated during the ground preparation. While under canopy, the student lost awareness of where he was at relative to the landing area and flew too far upwind of the drop zone. As a result, he ended up too low to safely clear an obstacle between himself and the drop zone. The student realized that he did not have sufficient altitude remaining to clear the obstacle, and decided to set up a landing in a cornfield to the north of the drop zone. The student's landing was not directly observed by any witnesses due to the obstacle between him and the drop zone, but he reported that he flared normally and had a soft landing. In spite of making a soft landing, the student suffered a minor laceration to his left hand from a corn leaf that cut his hand as he landed.

Emergency medical services rushed the instructor to a nearby trauma center, where medical personnel treated him for broken ribs, a broken pelvis and femur, a fractured spine and a small brain bleed.;Investigators interviewed local leadership and found that this instructor had a history of making low turns to landing, for which he had been admonished. Investigators reviewed photos and video of the incident and found no evidence of a malfunction or any other factor that could have explained the turn. Based on this information, investigators believe that the instructor made the large turn to induce speed for landing.   The Basic Safety Requirements specifically prohibits instructors from making a turn over 90 degrees under 500 feet AGL on a tandem skydive, because incident data shows that severity of injury is directly related to the degree of turn performed before landing. The BSRs were “established by evaluating incidents and identifying their root causes,” or, to use the more common expression, “The BSRs are written in blood.”;;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;2.0;No;done

According to historical data from Weather Underground, the temperature at the time of the jump was 70 degrees Fahrenheit on the ground with winds of 21 mph gusting to 30 mph. Earlier in the day, the drop zone had placed jumping activities on a weather hold. As the conditions slowly improved, the instructors met to reevaluate the conditions. Only this instructor was comfortable enough with the winds to jump, and he went up with his student to evaluate the conditions further. The tandem pair’s freefall, deployment and initial canopy flight were uneventful. The instructor reported no problems flying back to his holding area. Video of the landing showed that the he set up facing downwind before his turn to final, requiring him to turn 180 degrees if he were to face into the wind for landing. Although he later claimed that turbulence turned him 90 degrees and that he needed to turn another 90 to avoid hitting a hangar, he also told investigators that he always set up downwind and turned 180 degrees when winds were high. The pair hit the ground at a steep angle of attack. The hard impact killed the student instantly and rendered the instructor unconscious. The instructor suffered abrasions to his face, a broken femur and ribs and a fractured hip.;Exposing students to unknown weather situations is poor risk management. When evaluating weather conditions, it is much more appropriate for an instructor on solo equipment to perform a hop and pop, which minimizes the risk to the student. When it was windy, this instructor apparently routinely violated the Basic Safety Requirement that prohibits tandem instructors with students from making turns greater than 90 degrees below 500 feet AGL. Doing so puts a student in needless risk. Instructors must comply with the BSRs and refrain from speed-inducing turns for landing, and leadership at drop zones must treat BSR violations as egregious and take a hard stand when an instructor violates one. Individual members can also report BSR violations to USPA Headquarters and may send video or other evidence to safety@uspa.org.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;2.0;No;done

The freefall, breakoff and initial canopy flight were uneventful. The temperature was 80 degrees Fahrenheit on the ground with 4-8 mph winds in the landing area. Due to the heat, the density altitude was about 3,600 feet (meaning a canopy at ground level performs as if it were at that altitude, where the air is “thinner” than it would be on a cool day), and there was some turbulence due to thermal activity. There was a large amount of canopy traffic in the landing area.  The jumper’s canopy flight—her 12th flight on a canopy loaded at 1.5:1—was appropriate until just before landing. This jumper had taken two introductory canopy courses and was recently inquiring about taking a third canopy course, “Introduction to Induced-Speed Landings.” Her logbook showed that she had already begun experimenting with performing a brake-surge (using the toggles) to a front-riser maneuver to induce speed for landing. On final approach during this jump, this jumper performed a brake-surge-to-front-riser maneuver at approximately 100 feet AGL, too low to allow the wing to recover from its dive before landing.  Video showed that this jumper was active in the harness to keep the canopy on heading, with her hands up and around her risers. The footage was shot from too far away to see whether her hands were on the front or rear risers, but based the canopy’s reaction, it was likely the front risers. At approximately 15 feet above the ground (the point at which a flare should have begun), the canopy dove sharply at the ground. At this point, the jumper pulled even harder on the risers.   Just before landing, the jumper’s arms were bent to almost the quarter-brake position, but her hands were still around the risers. The jumper hit feet-first, crumpled and flipped over her head, with the canopy landing on top of her. Another jumper, a registered nurse, was only 20 feet away and provided immediate care to this jumper, who was breathing but unresponsive. The paramedics arrived within eight minutes and took over her treatment, but she soon stopped breathing and went into full arrest. The paramedics provided immediate emergency care and transported her to the hospital, but her injuries were not survivable.;Although this jumper worked with a canopy coach, the classes she took did not cover high-speed landing techniques, and she had been attempting induced-speed landings without any formal training. In addition, she was jumping a new, smaller wing and did not receive coaching on how to fly it but instead used self-taught induced-speed landing techniques. Apparently, she was not aware of the techniques used to recover from a steep dive, which include changes in body position or even stabbing out of the dive using the toggles (which would have occurred too low to prevent injury but may have spared her life). It is also possible that the jumper forgot that she was not pulling on the toggles but was still holding onto the front risers.   The jumper, who was 62 years old, may have had a slower reaction time than a younger jumper with similar experience. She was also not in great physical condition, which may have negatively affected her ability to perform some maneuvers, as well as to survive an injury. This jumper was landing in traffic in somewhat turbulent conditions, but there are no indications that these two factors played a direct part in the incident, although they may have been a distraction or increased the jumper’s stress. Regardless, the primary cause of this incident seems to have been the jumper overestimating her abilities at flying a new, smaller canopy in a high-performance manner without adequate training.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;12.0;No;done

One is a smaller landing area (40m x 150m) on the west side of the runway designated for Tandems and Staff members. On that day this landing area was used by skydivers for the first jump in the morning but restricted after that because of an Airshow event taking place, for which that space was used to park several aircraft. During the time of this event all skydivers, including Tandems, were using the larger landing area (300m x 220m) on the East side of the runway, designated for sports jumpers and students. At around 18:00 the Airshow was finishing and all but 1 aircraft had left the smaller landing area and the airfield when the last load of the day was going up. Therefore all 3 TIs going up agreed to use the smaller landing area for the last jump since the winds were mild and blowing in a favorable direction (from South) just like it had been the whole day. While climbing to altitude the pilot informed the people on board that it's raining about 10km SW from the DZ and they might need to jump from a lower altitude to avoid encountering it. All 3 TIs briefly discussed it but as they were approaching the usual jump altitude the rain had moved West and the ground was clearly visible. Therefore the jump procedure continued as usual. After an uneventful Tandem freefall together with a videographer and a good main canopy opening, the TI was steering towards the holding area on the west side of the runway to land on the smaller landing area. He saw the rain pouring down several kilometers to the West and felt a slight push from that direction but was still moving forward. He also noticed the videographer landing on the small landing area so he continued to move to the West. About 500m above the ground the TI felt that the wind from the West was picking up and it's now the the wind direction at the ground level too. About 300m above the ground the canopy almost stopped moving forward and was now slowly descending vertically. At this point the Tandem pair was above the North side of the small landing area. The TI was slightly overwhelmed by the situation and thought it's best to keep the slow vertical descent to the landing area underneath and to land facing a 40m opening between hangars looking to the west, to lessen the effects of turbulence. About 200m above the ground the wind had picked up even more and the occasional wind gusts seemed to push the canopy slightly backwards and the Tandem pair was now close to the runway. The TI briefly thought about crossing the runway to land on the bigger landing area but decided it's too risky below 300m also not being sure if there's any aircraft landing or taking off. At 100m the Tandem pair was above the runway and the TI decided to do a side-slide towards the opening between the hangars followed by a sharp turn into the wind to try to reach the landing area. But the wind was too strong and the Tandem pair was now descending vertically above the runway. Then the turbulence struck and the canopy lost some air pressure and was increasing the descent rate at 10m above the ground. The TI swiftly punched the toggles at the landing but it had no effect and the Tandem pair had a hard landing on the runway. The TI got away with bruises but the Tandem passenger got a fractured Coccyx and Sacrum because she lifted her legs up on the landing following the TI's command.;;10.68082948264327;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;2.0;No;done

The ground temperature was 75 degrees Fahrenheit with 7-15 mph winds in the landing area. The freefall portion of the skydive was uneventful, and everyone tracked away as planned at breakoff. No one observed the jumper’s opening sequence or initial parachute flight. When this jumper was at approximately 500 feet above ground level, a videographer on the ground observed him under an open and apparently fully functional main canopy; however, his reserve pilot chute was trailing behind him. The videographer then witnessed the jumper cut away from his main parachute. After the incident, inspection of the rig—which appeared to be in good condition—revealed that the reserve pilot chute had deployed but that the reserve, still packed in its freebag, remained in the reserve tray. Inspection also revealed that the automatic activation device had severed the reserve closing loop and that the jumper had pulled both the cutaway and reserve handles. After cutting away, the jumper fell out of sight behind a tree line without a reserve deployment. When responders located him shortly afterward, he was already deceased from the hard impact.";The configuration of the jumper’s gear after the incident indicates that the jumper deployed his main canopy at about the same time that his AAD fired and cut the reserve closing loop. Then, with the jumper flying under the main canopy, the reserve pilot chute did not have enough drag to pull the reserve out of its tray. Though no one witnessed the jumper’s deployment altitude, the AAD activation shows that it must have been extremely low … almost certainly below 1,000 feet. The reason for this jumper’s low main deployment is indeterminable, but individuals who jumped with this skydiver described him as someone who was known for pulling low. The USPA Basic Safety Requirements state that B-, C- and D-license holders must open their main containers by 2,500 feet (3,000 feet for A-license holders), which not only provides the jumper time to execute emergency procedures, if necessary, but also prevents unwanted AAD activations. This jumper had a low number of jumps compared to his time in the sport, which suggests that he did not jump frequently. A jumper who does not maintain a high level of currency would be wise to deploy the main parachute above the required minimum to allow extra time to react to an emergency. This also holds for older jumpers whose reaction times may be slower. At some point after his low main deployment, this jumper seems to have noticed that he was trailing his reserve pilot chute. It is impossible to know why the jumper decided to cut away his main and pull his reserve handle, but he was far too low to pick up enough speed for the pilot chute to extract the freebag from the container—much less for his reserve canopy to fully inflate—before he made impact with the ground. Jumpers must decide on a personal hard deck altitude—the lowest altitude at which they will cut away—before jumping. This altitude should be high enough to provide a reasonable amount of time for the reserve to completely inflate and additional time for the jumper to locate a suitable landing area. The Skydiver’s Information Manual recommends not cutting away below 1,000 feet, so most jumpers use this as their hard deck. This jumper was already below the recommended hard deck when his main inflated and more than 500 feet below it when he cut away. He would have fared much better if he had chosen to fly his main canopy calmly to the ground.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;No;No;6.0;Yes;done

The jumper was participating in a 7-way formation skydive, and her freefall and breakoff sequence were uneventful. Witnesses stated that the jumper deployed her parachute at 2,500 feet. Her main parachute opened fully but had line twists and started turning during the inflation stage. Shortly after deployment, the turn developed into a spin. A later inspection of the gear revealed no canopy damage, but the inspector noted that the right steering line was stowed and the left brake unstowed. Video of the deployment from one of the jumpers in the 7-way shows that the jumper saddled out under her main canopy at approximately 1,800 feet. She was still a spin, which persisted until she cut away 32 seconds later at approximately 200 feet above the ground. Later inspection of the gear showed the cutaway handle pulled but the reserve handle still stowed on the main lift web. The jumper’s gear was equipped with a functioning automatic activation device, but it did not activate. Three seconds after cutting away, the jumper died from making a hard impact with the ground without an open parachute.;"This jumper likely experienced a toggle fire (an unplanned toggle release) early in her deployment sequence. This situation is most commonly due to either packing error or reaching up early and inadvertently dislodging a toggle. The chances of a toggle dislodging increases when the retaining loops used to stow the excess brake line on the main risers are worn (it is unknown if this was the case in this incident; the inspector described the gear as “serviceable”), so jumpers should be sure to include this area in their regular gear inspections. Jumpers should take extra care when reaching for toggles during the inflation stage of deployment but should also consider waiting for the canopy to fully deploy before reaching for the toggles. This jumper deployed at 2,500 feet, the minimum deployment altitude, leaving her no margin for error. Among other things, jumpers need to take into account their experience, wing loading, currency and reaction time when determining a safe opening altitude. They must also consider how pulling at the bare minimum will affect their emergency procedures and understand that they must commit to cutting away if a problem arises, since they won’t have time to resolve it. This jumper saddled out at 1,800 feet and was already at the minimum recommended decision altitude for D-licensed jumpers. Consequently, she should have immediately performed her emergency procedures. Investigators determined that her average descent rate under her spinning malfunction was 50 feet per second (34 mph). At this decent rate, she had only 16 seconds of flight time before she reached 1,000 feet, the altitude at which cutting away the main canopy is no longer feasible. At 1,000 feet, jumpers should simply deploy the reserve canopy to slow their descent as much as possible before landing. Incident reports in 2021 show that line twists are the most common reason for cutaways, with toggle-brake line problems coming in a close second. When these problems present themselves individually, the jumper can usually rectify the situation. However, when line twists combine with toggle or brake-line problems, it’s likely that the jumper won’t be able to resolve the issues in the time available. When a toggle releases and puts a canopy into line twists, the twists lock in the uneven input, which makes the attempt to kick out them unproductive. Don’t delay, Cut away! In addition, jumpers must consider the effects aging has on cognition. This jumper was in her mid 60s. The ability to quickly assess surroundings and take action peaks in the 20s and gradually declines with age. Although experience helps jumpers handle complex scenarios, the negative effects of aging on reaction time and cognition can overtake the positive effects of experience as early as age 50. Jumpers 50 and older should factor this in when deciding on a deployment altitude and hard deck for emergency procedures to provide themselves more time to respond. Nine of the last 16 fatalities in the U.S. have involved jumpers 50 and older.";;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;Yes;No;No;No;No;No;7.0;No;done

After an uneventful freefall, the jumper found himself close to other skydivers while tracking away, which caused him to extend his track in order to open in clear airspace. As a result, he was under canopy at 2500 feet, but considerably far from the landing area. Initially, he believed he could make it back to the drop zone, but at 1500 feet, realized he would likely land in the trees adjacent to the landing area, and decided instead to land in a farm field close to the drop zone. He changed his intended landing pattern, and rather than attempt a low turn, chose to land crosswind in the field. While flaring for his landing, a rotor from the tree line pushed his canopy over to the right, and his right wrist struck the ground first, causing multiple broken bones.

The jumper was using a removable slider and after deployment, he checked it for canopy traffic, detached the slider and stowed it in his jumpsuit. Next, he moved the metal slider rings down the risers and away from the toggles and front-riser dive loops. However, the jumper missed clearing the right rear metal ring and when he released the toggles, the right brake line formed a hitch knot around the ring. The jumper tried to clear the knot for a few seconds, then briefly considered cutting away before realizing that he was already below his hard deck. Because he was unable to flare evenly with one toggle caught up, he attempted a rear-riser landing, which he had successfully performed during five previous jumps that day. Unfortunately, the impeded brake line changed the flight characteristics of the canopy, and the jumper was unable to set up and perform a proper landing. He struck the ground while still recovering from a dive, which caused a compression fracture of the lowest vertebra in his back. He was able to make a full recovery without surgical intervention.;This seemingly minor problem turned into a major malfunction partially because the jumper was not prepared for the scenario and did not have a planned and practiced set of responses. Jumpers need to be well versed on the possible problems their equipment could cause. When jumpers use specialty equipment, they need to seek out those who are experienced with it to learn about the malfunctions that could occur. They then need to mentally and physically rehearse malfunction scenarios until they are able to perform them properly during an actual emergency.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

The student had made several previous tandem jumps with this instructor. The exit weight of the tandem pair was approximately 250 pounds. They were jumping a United Parachute Technologies Sigma tandem system with a UPT VR360 reserve on a clear, 85-degree Fahrenheit day with reportedly light surface winds. The tandem pair made a stable exit into the relative wind, but the instructor forgot to deploy the drogue. Consequently, their freefall speed was fast, but the hand-mounted video camera footage showed that the pair was stable. At approximately 5,000 feet, the instructor attempted to deploy the main canopy, first by using the secondary drogue release, then by using the primary drogue release. These attempts were unsuccessful, since tandem main canopies will not deploy unless the drogue has been released. The pair rolled onto their sides just before the instructor deployed the reserve canopy at approximately 3,000 feet. The reserve canopy opened with approximately five or six line twists and began a cycle of surging and stalling, an intentional design feature (commonly referred to as the “rock and roll opening”) that provides the tandem reserve the descent rate of a round parachute until the brakes are released. This is a safety feature that prevents the tandem pair from traveling far from the opening point if the instructor is incapacitated. The canopy was also turning, and this combined with the stalls made it difficult for the instructor to resolve the line twists. The instructor was able to get out of the twists eventually, but not before the pair was below 1,000 feet. Fortunately, they were able to land safely in a clear, open area, although they were off the drop zone.;A local instructor examiner reviewed the incident and took the instructor out of rotation until completion of retraining on emergency and standard UPT procedures. Since the instructor was familiar with the student, he may have been complacent and approached this jump as a fun jump, using less caution than he would have on a standard tandem. No matter how experienced the jumper or how routine the jump, we should never lose respect for the dangerous environment we operate in. Jumpers must remind themselves that the next jump is just as dangerous as the last and give their full attention to the details from beginning to end. Research shows that lack of sleep can have as much effect on decision making as drinking alcohol. Although there is no evidence that this instructor was suffering from lack of sleep, the jump took place at the end of a long boogie weekend, and fatigue could possibly have been a contributing factor in the instructor failing to deploy the drogue. Fatigue can have a very tangible effect on performance, and accidents and injuries at drop zones increase when jumpers are fatigued.;19.165392531210586;Yes;No;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;No;done

The jumper’s freefall and initial canopy descent were presumably uneventful. The investigator began the report with the jumper entering the base leg of his landing pattern. After completing the downwind leg of his landing pattern, the jumper entered the base leg higher than planned. To bleed off altitude he extended the base leg past the landing area. He then turned 135 degrees onto his final leg, which put his flight path toward the landing area but 45 degrees off of the intended landing direction. At this time, the jumper presumably realized he was nearly at the same altitude as jumpers just turning onto their final legs, and he grabbed both front risers to dive his canopy toward the ground in a likely attempt to get below the other jumpers and land first. A Safety and Training Advisor who witnessed the incident stated that the jumper seemed to pay more attention to the other landing jumpers than to his own landing. The jumper continued pulling on the front risers until he hit the ground without flaring. Jumpers with prior medical training immediately attended to him until emergency medical services arrived. EMS transported the jumper to a local trauma center, where he was on life support for three days before he expired from his injuries.;This jumper was likely surprised that he reached the ground so quickly, because he was focused on trying to get out of the way of other landing canopies and lost track of his descent rate. Distracted landings cause a large percentage of landing fatalities, especially in the non-turn-related category. As jumpers get close to the ground, they must monitor several things to make a safe landing. Along with wind direction, ground track, descent rate and altitude over the ground, they must also monitor other traffic. Even in the most controlled landing areas, traffic can be challenging to track. This jumper likely became fixated on the other landing canopies and did not pay attention to the rest of factors he needed to in order to land safely. This jumper would have fared much better if he had turned onto his final leg higher and simply accepted that he would fly long of his intended landing area. Instead, the jumper fixated on trying to make his intended landing spot by choosing to adjust the landing pattern on the fly, which ultimately put him in a more dangerous situation.;8.424776007652747;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

The jumper exited Cessna Caravan 208B with two other jumpers for a 3-way formation skydive. The freefall and initial canopy flight were uneventful. As the jumper entered the landing pattern, he was reportedly a little bit too high to make an accurate landing but was otherwise flying appropriately. At approximately 150 feet above the ground, the jumper initiated a deep toggle turn that continued until he reached the ground. The investigator stated that this did not appear to be an attempt at a high-performance landing and theorized that the jumper initiated the turn to lose altitude, possibly to improve his accuracy. The jumper struck the ground hard, and when medical personnel arrived, they pronounced him dead at the scene.;A jumper should not make spur-of-the-moment landing adjustments unless confronted with an emergency situation such as an obstacle (in which case, the jumper should go into half-brakes to slow their descent and make a braked turn if altitude allows). Making significant adjustments simply to improve accuracy is counterproductive to the learning process and creates a dangerous situation for other jumpers. Once a jumper turns onto the final leg of their pattern, they need to accept their glide path and landing spot and make only minor corrections. They can then measure how far off their landing was and make appropriate corrections on the next jump. Taking a slow, methodical approach to landing accuracy is far safer and makes for more consistent, accurate landings in the long run.;1.1755588183144363;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;Yes;3.0;No;done

He was jumping out of a Beechcraft King Air under clear skies on an 80-degree summer day with 10- to 15-knot ground winds in the landing area. The drop zone is at a high elevation and therefore has a high density altitude (“thin air”), but this was the jumper’s home drop zone, so he was presumably used to these conditions. The weekend prior, this jumper attended a canopy course that covered basic swooping techniques at the same DZ. On this skydive, the jumper had an uneventful freefall and initial canopy descent. At about 400 feet, the jumper used both front risers to increase his descent rate, a maneuver typical for high-performance landings, then let up on his left front riser to make a right 90-degree turn to landing. Once the jumper completed the turn, he let up on the right riser to straighten out his canopy flight. However, the jumper’s canopy remained in a dive, which he then tried to retard by flaring with his toggles. He was able to flare only to shoulder level before reaching the ground. A witness 100 feet away saw the jumper make impact at approximately a 45-degree angle at about 50 miles per hour. Two jumpers—a former paramedic and a combat medic—arrived on the scene only moments after the accident and provided medical assistance. The jumper was unconscious and not breathing but had a pulse. They administered rescue breathing until emergency services arrived about 10 minutes later. The jumper was transported to the nearest trauma center but succumbed to his injuries later the same day.;The AFF Rating Course and Pre-Course jumps are extremely challenging, stressful and fast moving. During these jumps, examiners simulate being students in distress (e.g., spinning violently or flipped on their backs) and candidates must stretch their flying skills to respond. Candidates usually track away from these jumps with elevated heart rates from the adrenaline pumping though their veins. Adrenaline helps the body react by making the heart beat faster and increasing blood flow to the brain and muscles. After an adrenaline rush, it takes time for the body to return to a normal state. This jumper was likely still under the effects of adrenaline from the freefall jump and may have misjudged how much effort he put into his landing maneuver. Since this jumper had taken a swooping course the previous weekend, it is likely that he was trying to perform landing techniques he learned there. On this jump, he was also in the process of learning techniques for his AFF rating. Though the jumper may have thought that he was separating his learning processes, since one occurred in freefall and the other under canopy, his metabolism and brain function had probably not returned to normal by the time he set up for landing. Jumpers need to focus on learning one new thing at a time on each jump. Combining nerve-wracking experiences can have unintended consequences, as it may have in this incident. This jumper had 430 jumps and was flying a high-performance canopy that he loaded at 1.37:1. Although the jumper was described as “a conservative canopy pilot” to investigators, his choice of canopy was extremely aggressive for his experience level. The manufacturer of this canopy recommends its use only by advanced and expert canopy pilots, and this jumper was loading the canopy above the advanced level and into the expert range. With only 430 jumps and having recently completed an introduction to high-performance canopy flight, this jumper was likely not at the level considered “advanced,” much less “expert.” If he had been flying a canopy that turned less quickly and dived less steeply—one that was more forgiving of mistakes while a jumper is in a learning curve—he may have been able to survive the hard landing.;5.775536627199631;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

It was reportedly a clear, 75-degree day with no ground winds. As the jumper completed the turn at about 150 feet, the AAD activated, deploying the reserve canopy. The two canopies formed an unstable downplane, and the jumper hit the ground hard while attempting a parachute landing fall. The jumper broke one ankle and shattered the heel on the other foot. This jumper reportedly used a container equipped with a standard, non-changeable-mode AAD but swapped out the main canopies depending on what type of skydive he was making. When he was planning on making a high-performance landing, he would switch off the AAD. In a rush between loads, this jumper forgot to turn off his AAD before this jump.

The jumper flew a standard pattern using the main canopy’s toggles and made a stand-up landing. The investigating Safety and Training Advisor remarked that the jumper handled the challenging, low-altitude emergency well. After the jumper landed, a Federal Aviation Administration Senior Rigger inspected the gear and determined that the cutter on the jumper’s automatic activation device had fired and severed the reserve closing loop. When interviewed, the jumper remarked that he was not familiar enough with the AAD to know whether he had set it properly for his experience level and canopy-flying style and suggested that he may have inadvertently set the AAD to student mode, which fires at a higher altitude and a slower descent rate than the standard mode. The investigator also interviewed the FAA Senior Rigger who had performed the last reserve repack. The rigger reported that he had inspected the AAD cutter during the repack but had not turned it on or altered its settings.;This jumper could have prevented this incident if he had read the AAD owner’s manual, understood the firing parameters of each mode and set the AAD properly. Additionally, the skydiver did not receive a gear check at any point before the jump (although donning the equipment hid the AAD screen from view, so a gear check after putting the rig on would not have caught the issue).

The rigger reported that he had inspected the AAD cutter during the repack but had not turned it on or altered its settings.;This jumper could have prevented this incident if he had read the AAD owner’s manual, understood the firing parameters of each mode and set the AAD properly. Additionally, the skydiver did not receive a gear check at any point before the jump (although donning the equipment hid the AAD screen from view, so a gear check after putting the rig on would not have caught the issue). With the diversity of disciplines today, jumper must thoroughly understand the operating parameters of their automatic activation devices. There are many types of AADs on the market, including changeable-mode AADs, which can toggle between settings for solo students, tandem skydivers, experienced jumpers and high-performance canopy pilots. There are also specific AADs for wingsuit flyers. Jumpers need to refer to their owner’s manuals and learn the speeds and altitudes at which their specific AADs will activate or even disarm.

His rig was equipped with an AAD specifically designed for students (non-changeable mode). When the jumper reached the activation altitude of his student AAD, approximately 1,000 feet, jumpers under canopy above him saw him performing spiral turns. His AAD then fired, and his reserve fully deployed. He successfully cut away his main parachute, leaving him under a reserve that was fully open and stable. At approximately 50 feet, the jumper attempted to turn into the wind for landing. He hit the ground with his right toggle pulled down to hip level. Investigators reported that the impact was so hard that the jumper broke both femurs and both feet and ""exploded"" his lower vertebrae. Previously, the local S&TA had warned this jumper that he shouldn’t jump his current canopy using a student AAD because turning too abruptly at a low altitude would cause the AAD to activate. The jumper ordered an appropriate AAD, which arrived the morning of the incident, but he decided to keep jumping the old one until he could have the new one installed. In addition, the jumper had reportedly received repeated warnings about making low turns, including just a few days before the incident, when he made a low turn to face into the wind for landing. At that time, the S&TA reminded the jumper that a wing must have time to recover to level flight for landing after a turn and that only minor corrections to a flight path are acceptable under 300 feet. The investigator speculated that the jumper may have returned to the habit of turning low after the two-canopies-out situation overwhelmed him. Regardless, if the jumper had been using an AAD appropriate for his type of canopy flight, he would have avoided this situation and had enough time to set up for an appropriate landing.";With the diversity of disciplines today, jumper must thoroughly understand the operating parameters of their automatic activation devices.

The report then stated simply, “Hard landing. Didn’t finish flare.”;Although we appreciate jumpers filing incident reports at all, regrettably, this report did not offer much useful detail. Consequently, we are unable to provide much useful guidance beyond saying that when a flare or landing seems off, jumpers should perform a parachute landing fall. Therefore, we can only speculate. It is hard to believe that a jumper as current as this one would simply forget to flare. Could it be that someone or something caused a distraction? USPA’s Incident Reporting Form (available at uspa.org/ir) now includes a speculation section in addition to the description section, which is just for facts. By including speculation on why or how an incident occurred, USPA may gain an insight that cannot be derived from just the facts alone.

To work on accuracy, the jumper chose a windsock as the intended landing target. Unfortunately, the jumper was a little too accurate, and after making a turn to the final leg of the pattern, was on a direct course to hit the windsock. The jumper then initiated a last-minute turn to avoid the collision. In the confusion of the moment, the jumper forgot to flare or perform a parachute landing fall. The hard landing knocked the jumper unconscious.;There are far better options than picking an obstacle for a target when practicing accuracy. With a one-pound bag of flour, a jumper can draw a circle in a landing area visible from the start the landing pattern, and it will last for weeks. A one-pound bag of time-released fertilizer applied early in the year will also green up a target area, and it can last the entire season. Jumpers can also use a soft and flexible road cone, which they can move around to simulate different scenarios. These options require a little forethought, but all jumps do.

Approximately 1,500 feet after exit, the jumper had a premature opening while in a sit. The canopy, a 139-square-foot unreported model made by NZ Aerosports, deployed normally. The jumper sustained no injuries or equipment problems from the early deployment.;"Initially, investigators suspected that a loose bottom-of-container pilot-chute pouch caused the early deployment, but video revealed that the container opened prior to the pilot chute coming loose and that the jumper experienced an out-of-sequence deployment and a brief horseshoe malfunction (where the canopy is attached to the container by two points). Fortunately, the pilot chute eventually came out or the outcome could have been much worse. Investigators could not determine exactly when the pin became dislodged, but they suspect it happened during the exit. The two jumpers exited the aircraft facing one another, and this jumper may have rubbed the container against the door frame. Earlier that day, the jumper had noticed that the closing loop seemed looser than usual but did not make any further inspections or adjustments to it. Jumpers must not be lackadaisical about gear maintenance; their lives literally hang in the balance. If something does not seem right, take the time to investigate and rectify the problem before it results in an injury or worse. Premature deployments can be very serious. They quite regularly cause hard openings, which can result in damage to equipment, injury or even death. They also greatly increase the chance of entanglement. Had these jumpers had a bad exit or simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, one or both could have become entangled in the trailing equipment.

The freefall portion of the skydive and the deployment were uneventful. The jumper then flew his 139-square-foot Precision Aerodynamics Crossfire 3, which he loaded at 1.33:1, toward the landing area. It was a clear day with light 5- to 8-knot winds on the ground. The jumper opened fairly far from the landing are and used rear-riser input to make it back. This jumper barely made it to the landing area but was flying opposite the established landing direction. At that point, the jumper initiated a 180-degree turn at a low altitude. The jumper immediately realized that the turn was too low and attempted to flare. However, it was too late for the canopy to recover, and the jumper struck the ground at a high rate of speed. The jumper sustained a broken femur, broken pelvis, lumbar-transverse-process fracture and a small facial fracture. The jumper was airlifted to the hospital and despite the serious injuries is expected to make a nearly full recovery.;Although this jumper was active in the sport and had made 200 jumps in the last year, they did not have the time in the sport or the jump numbers to be able to fly a high-performance canopy, and the low-altitude emergency made this clear. The Skydiver’s Information Manual recommends that C-licensed skydivers load their canopies at 1.2:1 or less and that jumpers have a D license before using any canopy 150 square feet or smaller. Jumpers often use their recent jump numbers to justify aggressive canopy choices. How well and accurately a jumper can land their canopy in near-perfect conditions is not a good barometer of canopy skills. A far better metric is how well a jumper can handle bad landing conditions. This jumper likely fixated on landing onto the wind (not a landing priority) and experienced a self-induced low-altitude emergency by choosing to make a last-minute low turn. This jumper would have fared much better landing downwind or performing a slow, flat, 90-degree turn to land perpendicular to the wind line. Experiencing this problem on a larger, more forgiving canopy would have lowered the chance of injury and also provided the experience necessary to safely navigate the same problem after eventually downsizing. Most importantly, jumpers need to recognize early when they may not make it back to a landing area and begin planning for an alternative at an appropriate altitude.;6.476133307391437;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

As planned, he and the other jumpers deployed their main parachutes three seconds after exiting. This jumper exited in an unstable body position, and when he deployed his main, it began spinning. The jumper then began to rapidly lose altitude. The jumper was wearing a helmet-mounted video camera. Following the incident, law enforcement viewed the footage and provided it and the jumper’s gear to a Federal Aviation Administration investigator (who was also a FAA-certified parachute rigger) for analysis. Law enforcement did not allow any other investigators to inspect the footage or the gear. According to what the sole investigator told a representative of the drop zone, the video footage showed that the jumper was conscious throughout the entire descent and appeared to be working to solve the spin. He checked the altimeter numerous times before cutting away the spinning main canopy at approximately 3,000 feet. Following the cutaway, the video reportedly showed the jumper reaching or searching for his reserve handle. The jumper’s reserve static line was not attached (which is normal for canopy formation skydives) and his automatic activation device was turned off, so he continued in freefall. A witness on the ground who was not familiar with skydiving reported seeing the jumper under a spinning main parachute “very low” and then hearing a noise like a bang or a shot (most likely the sound of the reserve parachute opening) just prior to the sound of the impact. The reserve opened too low to inflate fully, and the jumper struck the ground at high speed. Responders found the jumper unresponsive in an area off the airport. Shortly thereafter, medical personnel arrived and declared the jumper deceased.;The root of this incident was a spinning main canopy. The jumper exited the aircraft and deployed the main canopy while in an unstable body position, which may have been the cause of the spin or a factor in it developing. If this jumper waited to deploy until he was flat and stable, it is more likely that his parachute would have opened properly. Although it is important to remember not to sacrifice altitude for stability (and to follow the pull priorities in Skydiver’s Information Manual 4-A), this jumper was at 13,000 feet when he deployed, so altitude would not have factored into his decision. Without access to the video, investigators initially thought that this incident was the result of a low cutaway based on the non-skydiver-witness report (which implied that the cutaway occurred below 1,000 feet) and the fact that investigators found the cutaway handle near the scene. Many days later, investigators found the main canopy far from the scene, which pointed toward the cutaway occurring higher than previously thought. The location of the main canopy confirms the information contained in the third-hand report of the events shown in the video, which estimates that the cutaway occurred at approximately 3,000 feet. The FAA investigator either did not know or did not report whether the jumper was having trouble locating the reserve handle or whether he had trouble physically gripping the handle. This jumper had undergone hand surgeries but reportedly never showed an inability to grasp or use his handles, so it is unclear whether this was a contributing factor in his inability to deploy the reserve in time. The use of an AAD or RSL would have prevented this incident. However, the jumper did not use these devices because he was making a canopy formation skydive. During CF skydives, where canopies are flying in close proximity and jumpers may be entangled together during a malfunction, jumpers generally opt against using RSLs. This used to hold true for AADs, as well. However, since AADs have become increasingly reliable and specialized, CF jumpers have increasingly begun using them. With a cutaway at 3,000 feet, this jumper would have reached a high enough freefall speed for the AAD to activate, deploy the reserve and save his life. This jumper initially deployed his main parachute at approximately 13,000 feet and spent 10,000 feet trying to correct the spin. Although it is at a jumper’s discretion, if they are at a safe altitude, as to whether they perform emergency procedures immediately upon recognition of a problem or work to solve it, realizing sooner that the problem was not solvable and cutting away higher would likely have prevented this fatality. Although 3,000 feet is usually high enough to allow a jumper to perform emergency procedures in time, the better option for this jumper—who was wearing no backup devices and had hand surgery in the past—would have been to start his emergency procedures at a higher altitude.;7.121038225568353;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;No;4.0;No;done

This jump—his second in the past 30 days—was his first flight on a 188-square-foot Aerodyne Research Pilot canopy at a wing loading of 1:1. He downsized from a 200-square-foot Performance Designs Navigator. The jumper’s exit, freefall and canopy flight were uneventful until he started his landing pattern. The winds were coming from an atypical direction for the landing area, so jumpers were flying unfamiliar patterns. This jumper was the last to land and set up for his landing high. As he approached a tree line at the far end of the landing area, he started a slow, right-hand turn at about 75 feet off the ground. During the turn, the jumper experienced turbulence, which collapsed his canopy’s left end cell. He did not flare, and when he landed, his hands were still in the toggles, but his right hand was all the way down and his left hand all the way up. The jumper made impact on the side of his body in a freshly plowed corn field. The report did not state whether he sustained injury.;Although this jumper’s canopy choice was not aggressive, he did downsize immediately after a long layoff, which is not a wise decision. The report stated that this jumper did not have confidence in his canopy flight and frequently did not land on his feet. It’s likely that the jumper panicked when hit by turbulence and probably reached for the ground with his right hand, forgetting about the left hand. This arm position increased the speed of turn, which the effect of turbulence also increased. Because he was at a low altitude, this jumper should have gone into half-brakes to stop the turn and returned to level flight as soon as he felt the turbulence, then finished his flare at an appropriate altitude.;1.7720915271119668;Yes;No;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done

The jumper, flying a Performance Designs Sabre2 135-square-foot canopy at a wing loading of 1.7:1, had 800 jumps in the past five years but only three in the last 30 days. Winds were a moderate 4-8 mph on the ground. The jumper turned onto the final leg of his landing pattern around 100 feet, and the canopy did not have time to recover from the turn before the jumper reached the ground. The jumper flared a little late and tried to slide in his landing, but his foot stuck in the soft ground. The report did not state whether this jumper suffered any injuries from his poor landing.;This jumper made a low turn and his skills may have been rusty after a layoff from jumping. It is much safer to make conservative choices when you haven’t been jumping as frequently. This incident is an excellent example of why it is important to start the turn to final at 300 feet, even if wind conditions are mild.

The weather conditions were appropriate for a student jump, with winds at about 5-10 knots and occasional light gusts. The student started the landing pattern with what the instructor felt were appropriate downwind and crosswind legs and turn to final approach. An instructor on the ground was in radio contact with the student, but the report did not state his location in relation to the student or what kind of view he had of the landing pattern. It did state that from the instructor’s vantage point, it initially appeared that the student was clear of all obstacles. However, the instructor realized shortly thereafter that the student might be over the hangar and told the student by radio, “If you are over the building, move to the side.” The instructor then told the student, “Standby,” likely in an attempt to tell the student not to flare yet. Immediately afterward, the student hit the hangar rooftop with no flare and fell an unreported distance to the pavement. The instructor immediately called 911, and the emergency medical technicians who responded took the student to a medical facility for examination. The report did not state what injuries the student sustained.;Although the staff tasked with guiding students in by radio should make every effort to do so effectively, students are ultimately responsible for their landings and should understand this. Radio assistance is precisely that: assistance. Students must learn proper landing procedures and understand how to avoid obstacles independent of radio control. Instructors must run students through various landing scenarios during emergency-procedure reviews to build the students’ confidence in their decision-making skills and abilities under canopy. This student should have gone into half brakes as soon as he realized he was going to land on the building. This may have given him time to perform a flat turn to avoid landing on the building altogether and perform the rest of the flare as he reached the ground. Going into half brakes would also have changed the canopy’s glide path, which could possibly have allowed him to fly over the building to land in the open area on its other side. At the very least, it would have slowed his descent rate and given him more time to decide on an appropriate action.;0.1150685144697561;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

The student continued his final approach in level flight, occasionally in half brakes, until he struck a tree at the north end of the landing area while about 30 feet above the ground.

While entering his designated landing pattern, the jumper performed a stall surge (brought the canopy to the brink of a stall and then allowed it to surge forward) just prior to performing a 90-degree front-riser turn to final approach at an altitude described as “appropriate” for a 90-degree turn. After making the turn, the jumper paused—possibly in an attempt to avoid landing near an aircraft taxiing beside the landing area—and then initiated a second 90-degree turn using front-riser and harness input, for a total turn of 180 degrees. He did not have enough altitude to complete the second part of the 180-degree turn and, according to a witness in the landing area, made no input to recover the canopy to straight-and-level flight before he struck the ground with his canopy still at a high angle of attack. The jumper received immediate assistance from those at the drop zone, but he died instantly from blunt-force trauma. Emergency medical responders declared him dead at the scene.;Local jumpers stated that on many occasions, concerned peers told this jumper that he was being too aggressive with his canopy piloting and downsizing and needed to slow down. Investigators also discovered that although he reported having 350 jumps, his true jump numbers were closer to 275, which included 70 military static-line jumps and 25 military freefall jumps using 360-square-foot canopies. From the evidence, it appears that he had made approximately 180 civilian sport jumps. During the first jump of the course (a skill-assessment jump), the jumper chose to perform a stall surge, an advanced landing maneuver that he learned about at some point prior to the course. In this maneuver, the canopy pilot brings the canopy to the brink of a stall and then allows it to surge forward just prior to performing a high-performance front-riser turn. This jumper did not know (or chose to ignore) the fact that safety dictates performing this maneuver on 270-degree or greater turns for landing, since those turns are performed at a higher altitude and give the canopy a chance to recover if something goes wrong. Depressurizing a canopy close to the ground is hazardous because it becomes susceptible to weather anomalies such as thermals, turbulent air, rotors and other conditions that can make it unstable or even collapse, and altitude loss is unpredictable. The stall-surge maneuver was far outside this jumper’s abilities and knowledge. In order to attend this course, this jumper may have inflated his experience level and the type of experience he had. This incident illustrates the hazards of the Dunning-Kruger effect, which describes the psychological trait where people with below-average skill or knowledge tend to grossly overestimate their own abilities and where those who lack skill fail to recognize it in others. This is essentially the trait skydivers refer to when they use the phrase “200-jump wonder” (or 100-jump wonder or 500-jump wonder, depending on the situation). In this case, the jumper’s mentors and course director were unable to provide him appropriate advice and training because they didn’t have an accurate picture of his skills and experience.

She then experienced two simultaneous malfunctions: line twists and a spinning main canopy that dove toward the ground. The jumper fought for control of the canopy until around 1,200 feet, then began initiating her emergency procedures. She cut away at about 900 feet. She then fought to get into a belly-to-earth orientation before deploying her reserve at about 200 feet. The reserve had just cleared the freebag when the jumper struck the ground.;This jumper was a current and active skydiver, and she deployed her main canopy at an altitude that would have allowed for a successful reserve deployment had she performed her emergency procedures immediately. It is not known why she stayed with the main parachute until she was at such a low altitude, although she may have become overly focused on attempting to clear the line twists and recovering the canopy to straight-and-level flight. Regardless, it appears she lost altitude awareness. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that jumpers initiate emergency procedures by no lower than 2,500 feet for students and A-license holders and by 1,800 feet for B-, C- and D-license holders. SIM Section 4 recommends that jumpers locate the reserve handle before pulling the cutaway handle and pull the reserve handle immediately after cutting away the main canopy. This jumper’s equipment contained a traditional reserve static line, which—had it been connected—would have pulled the reserve ripcord immediately after release of the main parachute. Reportedly, this jumper usually connected her RSL, and it is unclear why it was not connected for this jump. Although she may have chosen not to connect it, it is likely that it was an oversight that no one caught in a gear check. This jumper had traveled on a commercial airline away from her home DZ for a winter skydiving trip and then made several jumps over a few days. It is possible that she disconnected her RSL to reduce the chance of the RSL lanyard snagging and accidently activating the reserve when passing through security or baggage claim. If this was the case, anybody in the loading area or during the climb to altitude on her multiple jumps could have noticed that the RSL was not connected and prevented this tragedy by bringing it to the jumper’s attention. It is also possible that she chose not to connect her RSL for some reason. However, testing and statistics show that in almost all circumstances—even violent, spinning malfunctions under moderately to highly loaded canopies—jumpers are much better off using an RSL than not. This circumstance—riding a canopy with spinning line twists to a low altitude and then trying to get stable after cutting away before pulling the reserve—is not uncommon. This jumper was likely a victim of cognitive tunneling, caught in the trap of trying to fix a canopy that couldn’t be fixed in the time remaining. Jumpers must initiate emergency procedures at or above the recommended hard deck. In this incident, as well as in many other similar ones, an RSL could have prevented the fatality. This fatality was the result of several errors that combined to create a fatal outcome. Removing any one of the errors may have changed the outcome and prevented the fatality. Jumpers need to say vigilant when handling, donning and using their equipment. In addition, they need to remain altitude aware, deploy at the correct altitude and be ready to initiate emergency procedures while there is still enough altitude remaining to safely deploy a reserve canopy.;20.0953387856294;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;8.0;No;done

Cleared for self-supervision on the third jump of the day, the student exited stable at 13,500 feet. The student was able to perform and recover from a barrel roll and front flip, but when he did a back flip on this jump, he was unable to recover. While stuck in a back-to-earth orientation, the student continued attempts to roll over until approximately 1,200 feet. The student deployed the main canopy concurrently while the AAD activated the reserve. With the two canopies out, it immediately developed into a down-plane to which the student immediately cut-away. Now trailing his main due to a reserve static-line (RSL) entanglement he disconnected his RSL which released his main canopy from the entanglement. The student then landed off-field with no injuries.;Due to the physical constraints of the student’s amputations and the efforts used in stability recovery, this student was beyond physical limits after completing two prior jumps. While unsuccessful in recovering from a back-to-earth orientation, the student lost altitude awareness. The student remembered 6,000 feet as the last altitude check. The main parachute deployed at 1,600 feet while the student was in a back-to-earth orientation. The student was retrained on altitude awareness and pull priorities. SIM Section 4-A 1. Solo: General Section C.6.c outlines the three pull priorities. Deploying in a stable body position will help to reduce the chances of experiencing a parachute malfunction, but a jumper should never sacrifice altitude for stability.;0.4038042703453072;Yes;No;Yes;student;Yes;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

Prior to the jump, he was alert and engaged during the dirt dive and received a gear check from the local Safety and Training Advisor. The other jumpers noted that he appeared stable and in control as the formation built. Although video taken by those on the jump shows that he went approximately 75 feet low of the formation, he appeared in control and as if he were working to rejoin the formation until the jumpers tracked away during breakoff. Experienced skydivers watching from the ground reported that after the other jumpers tracked away, this jumper remained in freefall until his reserve deployed at an altitude between approximately 400 and 700 feet. The reserve achieved line stretch, sniveled momentarily and inflated just as he passed out of the ground witnesses’ sight behind a tree line. A witness under canopy reported seeing this jumper’s reserve deploy and his canopy inflate immediately before he made impact in a small pond. Drop zone staff, led by the Safety and Training Advisor who was in radio communication with the now-circling jump plane, located the jumper and were on the scene 12 minutes later. They found the jumper unresponsive and submerged in two feet of water, 10 feet from shore with his face up and eyes open. After pulling him from the water, they performed CPR until emergency personnel arrived on the scene, which took 20 to 30 minutes due to the area’s remote location and heavily wooded terrain. The emergency personnel continued CPR and transported him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead later in the day.;A Federal Aviation Administration Senior Rigger, who inspected the equipment at the scene, and the local authorities found no evidence of an equipment problem. The automatic activation device manufacturer received the AAD for inspection and retrieved its data, which showed that it activated properly at the assigned altitude. The data also showed that there was a brief delay in deceleration right after activation (possibly due to a pilot-chute hesitation) and that the jumper continued decelerating until the reserve opened fully immediately before impact. This corroborates eyewitness testimony. Autopsy results indicate the victim suffered a “significant cardiac event” during the skydive and that this caused the jumper’s death prior to his impact with the pond. Since the jumper was engaged and alert until breakoff and then took no further action, this is likely when he experienced the heart attack. The jumper, who was 57, had no apparent medical issues and had not declared any on his waiver, but conversations between investigators and family members later revealed that heart disease ran in the victim’s family. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 2-1-C states that all skydivers engaging in skydiving must possess at least a current FAA Third-Class Medical Certificate, carry a certificate of physical fitness for skydiving from a registered physician or agree with this statement: “I represent and warrant that I have no known physical or mental infirmities that would impair my ability to participate in skydiving, or if I do have such infirmities, that they have been or are being successfully treated so that they do not represent any foreseeable risk while skydiving. I also represent and warrant that I am not taking any medications or substances, prescription or otherwise, that would impair my ability to participate in skydiving.” As the jumping population ages, more jumpers are at risk of experiencing medical emergencies during skydives. Most medical experts recommend that men and women over age 40 receive medical checkups at least once a year. Those who have a family history of heart disease or other health issues should consult with a doctor about additional screening. Skydiving places stress on the body and gives jumpers a good reason to stay on top of medical problems.;3.0701895806357777;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;10.0;No;done

The instructor then briefed the student on how to steer and land the canopy. About two minutes of silence followed. After the silence, the student reported feeling “jostling” behind him and then saw his instructor’s legs coming up in front of him. He reached back and discovered his instructor was no longer with him. The student, realizing he was alone and not flying toward the airport, used the toggles that he still had in his hands from the briefing to turn the canopy to face the airport and line up with the runway. He followed the runway until he landed near the end of it. He landed in a sitting position with his legs up, as he had learned in his ground briefing before the jump, and walked away unassisted. Medical professionals examined him later and reported that he sustained only minor bruising. Several agencies immediately began an exhaustive search for the instructor using aircraft and other techniques. They found him deceased approximately 27 hours later in a heavily wooded area northwest of the intended landing area.;Multiple organizations—including the state police, the Federal Aviation Administration and the gear manufacturer—conducted an extensive, almost two-month-long investigation into this incident. The FAA and the gear manufacturer performed an inspection of the equipment and found no defects. After interviewing industry experts and concluding that an experienced skydiver would not accidentally loosen a harness enough to slip out, the state police ruled the death a suicide. They did not report whether the instructor left behind a note. Additionally, the coroner sent fluid and tissue samples to a medical lab for toxicology testing, which tested for a variety of substances, including cannabinoids. Unlike a standard urinalysis, which tests for the inactive metabolite THC, post-mortem testing detects the primary psychoactive agents in marijuana—Delta-9 THC and Delta-9 Carboxy THC—and can determine whether a person was actively under the influence of marijuana at the time of death. The report for this jumper indicated that he had sufficient levels of Delta-9 THC and Delta-9 Carboxy THC in his system to be considered under the influence and suggests that he had likely ingested marijuana shortly before the jump. Being under the influence of marijuana may have affected this jumper’s judgment. It is against FAA and USPA regulations to skydive while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Federal Aviation Regulation Part 105.7 states the following: “No person may conduct a parachute operation, and no pilot in command of an aircraft may allow a person to conduct a parachute operation from that aircraft if that person is or appears to be under the influence of— (a) Alcohol, or (b) Any drug that affects that person’s faculties in any way contrary to safety.” Additionally, tandem instructors must hold an FAA Third-Class Medical Certificate, which requires reporting drug use—legal or illegal—since the last renewal of the medical. Thankfully, positive test results for drug or alcohol use following a skydiving fatality are rare. It goes without saying that jumping while impaired by any drug or alcohol adds risk not only to the impaired jumper but all other jumpers on the load, the pilot and the drop zone owner, as well as people on the ground.;20.67589832553392;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;2.0;No;done

The jumper’s exit, freefall and deployment were uneventful. Investigators reported that the jumper initiated deployment of her main parachute at approximately 5,500 feet. The ground winds were reportedly 10-13 mph and the upper winds were unknown. Due to the bright sunlight behind the student, the person operating the ground-to-air radio to help with the student’s descent lost sight of her. Unassisted by radio, the student flew the parachute crosswind away from the drop zone. By the time she came back into view of the radio operator, she could no longer reach the main landing area. Once it became clear that the student could not make it back, the radio operator instructed her to locate an open field to use for a landing area. The student then turned the parachute downwind toward a large field and continued in this direction until she disappeared from the view of the jumpers who were watching from the drop zone. Shortly after she landed, responders found her unconscious next to a barn with her head underneath an iron rod that connected a tractor to a wagon. Based on her location, investigators determined that she remained flying downwind after disappearing from the view of the jumpers at the airport and struck the side of the barn when she was a few feet above the ground. She suffered two broken femurs and a severe head injury. She received immediate first aid and was airlifted to a hospital but never regained consciousness due to the severe head injury. Her family decided to remove her from life support after a week, and she died soon afterward.;Off-field landings create additional risks for jumpers of all experience levels, but especially students who are just learning to fly and land parachutes. Without any nearby wind indicators, it is likely that this inexperienced jumper was unable to determine the direction the wind was blowing as she attempted to land off the drop zone. If a jumper landing off-field can determine wind direction, the safest option, altitude permitting, is to fly a standard landing pattern that allows for a final approach and landing into the wind. However, although it is preferable to land facing into the wind to achieve the slowest possible ground speed, this jumper could have landed safely flying downwind if she had landed in a clear, open area with the wing level. This jumper may have experienced target fixation, focusing on the landing hazard and subconsciously steering toward it instead of to a clear area. Had this jumper made a slight heading change toward the flat, open ground surrounding her, the landing may have been uneventful. Investigators reported that based on paint transfer markings, it appeared that her helmet struck the side of the barn, as well as the iron rod that was just above her head when responders found her on the ground. The vast majority of helmets used for skydiving offer very limited head protection. In cases such as this, where there is a relatively high-speed impact against a stationary obstacle, severe trauma to the head is very likely even when the jumper is wearing a helmet.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done

At approximately 50 feet, he initiated an aggressive 180-degree turn to the left, too low for the parachute to recover to straight and level flight. He struck the ground while in a steep, diving descent. The hard landing resulted in multiple broken bones and a severe head injury. He received immediate medical attention, and an ambulance took him to the hospital, where he remained on life support for several days. However, he had a severe brain injury and died after being removed from life support.;Investigators reported that this jumper was very current, having completed 275 jumps in the nine months since he started skydiving. His previous canopy-piloting experience and his experience under his current parachute were not reported, but with just 275 total jumps, he likely did not have many jumps on his current parachute, which was a fully elliptical nine-cell that he loaded at 1.3:1. The manufacturer of the canopy recommends that jumpers at that wing loading have an advanced level of experience, and most industry experts would agree that someone with 275 jumps does not fall into the advanced category. In general, a fully elliptical parachute will lose more altitude in a turn than a non-elliptical parachute. This jumper may not have been aware of just how rapidly the parachute would dive toward the ground when he made the aggressive left turn. Jumpers should gradually progress to jumping higher-performance parachute designs. Training and advice from an experienced canopy coach can help reduce the risks of downsizing and learning to jump high-performance parachutes. This jumper was flying toward a building on final approach, and if he continued to fly straight forward, he likely would have struck it or touched down just before reaching it. There were clear areas to his left and right and no nearby canopy traffic. If he had made a slight heading change in either direction, he would have found clear, flat areas: an asphalt road on the left and a dirt strip on the right. It is unknown why he initiated an aggressive 180-degree turn, but he may have been attempting to remain over the grassy area. This jumper misjudged his final approach, and the location of the building did not allow him to land long while flying straight. Jumpers should plan landing patterns that provide extra room in case they make errors in landing accuracy or have the need to avoid canopy traffic or deal with thermal activity that slows the parachute’s descent rate and extends its glide. The longer a jumper waits to take corrective action, the fewer options are available. At lower altitudes, jumpers should perform only slight heading corrections so the parachute does not dive toward the ground. Jumpers must complete all turns with enough altitude for the parachute to return to level flight before the landing flare.;7.681022934901565;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

The four wingsuit flyers exited at about the same time, and this jumper and another lost stability and tumbled for a second or two. The two jumpers regained stability about five seconds after exiting but then collided. After the collision, witnesses in the plane observed that one of the jumpers was unresponsive and spinning in a back-to-earth orientation. He remained that way until he disappeared from their view. The other jumper involved in the collision was not injured. The unresponsive jumper continued in freefall until his automatic activation device activated and his reserve parachute deployed and inflated at an unreported altitude. A witness on the ground observed the jumper unresponsive under his reserve parachute just before he landed on the roof of a house. First responders arrived soon after the jumper landed and declared him dead at the scene.;Although this jumper loaded his reserve parachute relatively heavily at 1.6:1 and was unresponsive for landing, investigators believe that he did not sustain serious injury from the landing and that the head and neck injuries he suffered during the collision were fatal. Investigators reported that both wingsuit jumpers were current and experienced with flying wingsuits. When the jumpers lost stability, the distance between them increased. Once this jumper recovered from the tumble and began flying, he built up enough forward speed and energy to cause severe injury to his head and neck when he collided with the other jumper. Investigators did not report where he struck the other jumper’s body, only that the other jumper was not injured and was able to deploy his main parachute to land uneventfully. Several similar collisions between wingsuiters in recent years have resulted in fatalities such as this one. Wingsuits produce rapid acceleration and forward speeds, and jumpers often collide head-first, unable to protect their heads because their arms are trapped at their sides by the arm wings. Although this jumper wore a helmet, the impact was severe enough that the helmet could not provide adequate protection to prevent injury. Investigators could not determine whether this jumper did not see the other wingsuit flyer before the collision or whether he saw the other jumper but was unable to avoid the collision. Wingsuit jumpers must exercise caution and maintain enough separation from other jumpers during exit and freefall to avoid colliding at high closure rates that can lead to serious injuries or fatalities. Although the size and wing loading of the main and reserve parachutes were likely not factors in this accident, jumpers should consider selecting lightly loaded parachutes for wingsuit flying. In addition, jumpers of any discipline have a larger chance of serious injury or death when landing unconscious without flaring under highly loaded canopies because of their faster forward speeds and higher descent rates.;;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;4.0;No;done

After an uneventful freefall, he deployed his main parachute at or slightly above 2,500 feet, and his freefall computer showed that he had a fully inflated canopy at 2,150 feet. The jumper was shooting footage with a helmet-mounted video camera, which investigators reviewed to determine the details of the accident. The main parachute deployed with line twists and began to spin as soon as it inflated. The spin continued for 43 seconds, which was the remainder of the descent. The jumper reached up toward the risers very briefly about 10 seconds before he struck the ground, but that was the only time his arms were in view. It is likely that he was working to unzip the arm wings of the suit so he could reach his risers to try to clear the line twists. The jumper struck the ground under the rapidly spinning canopy. Investigators reported that responders found him with the cutaway handle and reserve ripcord handle still in place on his harness. The arms of the wingsuit were unzipped, and the zippers worked correctly. The jumper received immediate first aid, but the hard impact had killed him instantly. Medical personnel declared him dead at the scene.;This jumper was a very experienced wingsuit jumper with thousands of wingsuit jumps, although with only 75 jumps in the previous year, he may not have been very current. Investigators reported that he had correctly cut away and deployed his reserve parachute while wearing his wingsuit several times in the past. Investigators believe he lost altitude awareness while he worked to unzip his arm wings, losing valuable time and altitude in the process. Wingsuit jumpers can pull emergency handles without unzipping their arm wings. Instead of trying to unzip his arms, this jumper should have initiated emergency procedures by immediately pulling his cutaway handle followed by his reserve ripcord handle. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that all B- through D-licensed skydivers initiate emergency procedures by at least 1,800 feet. This jumper began his deployment at around 2,500 feet, and his main parachute was fully inflated at approximately 2,150 feet. This left just a few seconds after main deployment before he reached the decision altitude of 1,800 feet. Since wingsuits can add complications to deployments, wingsuit flyers should consider deploying higher than the minimum to give themselves extra time to deal with problems that may arise. This jumper was flying a canopy loaded at 1.5:1. Because of the increased possibility of line twists when flying a wingsuit, industry experts recommend that wingsuit flyers use canopies loaded at 1.3:1 or lighter to minimize the severity of a malfunction. While it is usually possible to clear line twists when a parachute is flying wing-level toward the horizon, it is far more difficult (or even impossible) to clear line twists when the parachute is spinning and the jumper is rotating rapidly around it. Jumpers must be ready to treat spinning line twists as a malfunction and initiate emergency procedures to release the main parachute and deploy the reserve at or above the decision altitude.

The exit, freefall and breakoff were uneventful. She deployed her main parachute at approximately 2,500 feet, and the parachute immediately entered a spin that continued for the remainder of the descent. Witnesses on the ground and in the air reported seeing the jumper limp and motionless in the harness. Responders found her soon after she made impact with the ground. She was on her left side with both arms down at her side. Investigators reported that they found the main toggles stowed on the risers and the left steering line broken below the cascade. Her cutaway and reserve-ripcord handles were in place on the harness. First responders found the jumper unresponsive, blue in color, cool to the touch at her extremities and with no pulse. They gave her immediate first aid, but she did not respond to attempts to revive her. Emergency personnel declared her dead at the scene.;This jumper was a very current and experienced skydiver who was jumping at a large skydiving event. This was her first jump of the day but her second day jumping with a demo canopy provided by the manufacturer’s representative at the event. Investigators reported that a packer with a Federal Aviation Administration Senior Rigger certificate packed her main parachute. Investigators reported that the manufacturer inspected the parachute after the incident. The left brake line and several suspension lines were broken, several line attachment points were torn or damaged, and the slider was damaged from line burns. The damage found to the parachute, slider and suspension lines indicate that a very hard opening occurred. Hard openings can occur with any parachute and are almost always a result of packing errors. The overall precision and neatness of the pack job, the placement of the slider, how the packer controlled the parachute when placing it in the deployment bag and the method and type of line stows have the most effect on the speed of the opening. Other factors may be the condition and size of the pilot chute and the jumper’s freefall speed. Following the manufacturer’s packing instructions helps to ensure a parachute opens correctly. The coroner did not perform an autopsy. However, the jumper appeared blue and was already cool to the touch at her extremities when responders found her, which bears similarity to other fatal accidents in which jumpers over age 60 experienced torn aortas due to hard openings. Since 1999, at least 14 fatal accidents are attributable to hard openings of the main or reserve parachute.;45.58370421181001;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;5.0;No;done

They observed him flying his parachute on a straight path as he worked his way back to the drop zone. He reached the main landing area when he was approximately 1,000 feet above the ground. Shortly after that, the parachute began to spin to the right. The jumper rotated around the parachute at nearly its level as he descended rapidly toward the ground. His arms were above his head as he worked to regain control of the parachute. However, after only approximately five revolutions, he struck the ground hard while still in a rapid spin. He received immediate medical attention, but the impact killed him instantly.;Investigators reported that they found the main canopy with the right brake line stowed and the left brake line unstowed, which would account for the right-hand spin witnesses observed. When they inspected the gear, they pulled the right toggle, and it released the brake line normally. The jumper was wearing gloves, and it was reportedly a relatively cold day, both of which may have affected his dexterity. First responders found him wearing only his right glove, and no one ever found the left one. Investigators could not determine when or why he removed the glove. Investigators believe that the jumper left both brakes stowed during his relatively long parachute flight to the landing area, attempted to release them at approximately 800 feet in preparation for landing and only the left brake released. He may have missed the right toggle and run out of time before he could release the other one. At an altitude as low as 800 feet, a better option than reaching for the stowed brake may have been to stop the spin by pulling the free brake line down until the cat eye on the line was even with the guide ring on the brake setting. This would have stopped the spin and returned the parachute to level flight. Though landing in half-brakes using one toggle is not ideal since it doesn’t allow a flare, it is much more desirable than striking the ground in a rapidly descending spin. If the jumper had released his brakes higher, he would have had additional time to deal with any problems. The priority for every skydiver after deployment is to make a visual inspection and a controllability check of the parachute to make sure it can be steered in each direction and flared for landing. Jumpers should perform this check immediately after deployment and should complete it before reaching the decision altitude for emergency procedures, which is 2,500 feet for students and A-license holders, and 1,800 feet for B- through D-license holders.;2.5318117800661843;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

The exit, freefall and main-canopy deployment were uneventful, although the instructor did not perform a system-handles check during freefall. When the instructor deployed the main canopy, it opened correctly and initially flew straight and level. However, when she attempted to release the brakes with a quick tugging motion, the left side released, but the right-side steering line remained attached to the back of the riser at the loop that passes through the cat’s eye, and the canopy began to spiral to the right. At this point, the instructor tried to release the right brake line by pulling on the right toggle a few times, and then she attempted to stop the spin by pulling on the opposite toggle. She also dropped both toggles at times, reaching with both hands toward the right rear riser in an attempt to reach the brake. Although the main cutaway handle was in view and accessible, she never reached for it. She pulled the reserve ripcord without first cutting away, and the reserve pilot chute deployed and trailed behind the tandem pair at the bridle connection for the SkyHook main-assisted-reserve-deployment (MARD) system. By the time the instructor pulled the reserve handle, the cutter for the automatic activation device had already activated and cut the reserve closing loop. This indicates that she pulled the reserve ripcord handle at or below the 1,900-foot AAD activation altitude. The instructor pulled the reserve ripcord multiple times, and each time the ripcord pull stopped after about six inches, when the reserve closing pin came into contact with the ripcord housing. This can occur on systems that use reserve ripcords with a separate closing pin attached to the reserve static line, such as this one. If the Velcro tab used to hold the reserve-static-line lanyard and closing pin in place comes loose, it allows the closing pin to remain attached to the reserve ripcord as the ripcord is pulled. The reserve ripcord cannot move through the ripcord housing unless the reserve closing pin detaches. After attempting multiple ripcord pulls, she let go of the reserve handle and grabbed the toggles again in an attempt to stop the spin. At that point, the reserve freebag came out of the container from the left side and began to trail behind the tandem pair as the reserve lines unstowed. The reserve parachute remained in the freebag, held in place by the locking stows, and the reserve pilot chute still trailed from the MARD attachment point. Under the spinning main canopy, there was not enough drag for the pilot chute to pull the MARD free from the container. While this is a possibility on any parachute system, any container equipped with a MARD device adds more hardware and complexity to the system that may prevent the reserve from being easily extracted while descending under a fully inflated main parachute. The tandem pair continued to spin under the main parachute, trailing the reserve pilot chute and freebag, until they struck the ground at a high speed. Both jumpers died instantly from the impact.;The main parachute, container and reserve were all found to be in airworthy condition. Investigators reported that they were able to release the right brake line on the ground. They believe that if the instructor had pulled the right toggle farther down or used more force, the right brake would have released from the locking loop. This canopy had two-piece brake lines (which have upper and lower line sections), which may be more prone to getting trapped than one-piece systems when under a load (such as in situations like this). However, it is impossible to determine whether the brake line was truly trapped in some way or whether the instructor simply needed to pull the toggle farther and harder. After several attempts to stop the canopy’s spin, the instructor did not reach for the main cutaway handle (which was in its normal location and accessible) but instead attempted to pull the reserve ripcord. This action was not in keeping with the manufacturer’s emergency procedures for a partial malfunction, which calls for pulling the cutaway handle, ensuring both main risers release and then pulling the reserve-ripcord handle. She also initiated these procedures at or below 1,900 feet. USPA recommends initiation of tandem emergency procedures no lower than 3,500 feet. The instructor likely expected the reserve ripcord to pull completely through the housing, and the inability to pull it through may have confused her. Investigators could not determine whether she was intending to deploy the reserve parachute without cutting away in an attempt to make a canopy transfer (which the manufacturer specifically forbids) or whether she simply made a mistake performing her emergency procedures. She did not perform a handles check during freefall, and investigators reported that videos of her previous tandem skydives did not show any system-handles checks either. USPA’s Basic Safety Requirements stipulate that instructors must make system-handles checks during every tandem skydive to reinforce correct tandem emergency procedures and verify that the handles are accessible. A last option in this situation may have been to pull the left brake down to the point where the finger trap reached the brake setting. Holding the left side down to match the right side would have caused the canopy to stop spinning and return to level flight. The tandem pair could then have landed with the main canopy in half-brakes without the ability to fully flare the canopy for landing. This instructor received her initial tandem training from an instructor examiner who later had his rating revoked. Although USPA did not require it, this instructor underwent voluntary retraining. However, it appears that she may have picked up poor habits that the retraining did not overcome. Tandem parachute systems and tandem emergency procedures are more complex than solo systems and procedures. Tandem instructors must repeatedly review emergency procedures in a training harness to help ensure a correct response to each type of emergency. This tandem instructor held a tandem instructor rating for more than two years, but it is unknown whether she regularly practiced emergency procedures.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;2.0;No;done

The tandem instructor, who was wearing a hand-mounted video camera, rolled forward off the step above the landing gear with her left arm extended to film the skydive. The pair tumbled, and the instructor threw the drogue parachute while they were still unstable and not facing into the relative wind. Consequently, the drogue bridle passed across the back of the tandem instructor’s legs and entangled with her ankle. As the tandem pair continued in droguefall, the instructor attempted to disentangle the fully inflated drogue from her ankle. At approximately 2,000 feet, the automatic activation device cut the reserve closing loop and released the reserve. Although the instructor pulled the cutaway and reserve-ripcord handles at approximately the same time, the fact that the AAD cutter severed the reserve closing loop indicates that she pulled the reserve ripcord after it activated. The reserve bridle and freebag initially entangled with the drogue, but the reserve parachute was able to escape the freebag. However, the reserve did not have enough time to fully inflate before the tandem pair struck the ground at a high speed. Both jumpers died instantly from the impact.;The instructor was current and experienced, having completed more than 1,000 tandem skydives since earning her rating in 2014. Investigators used footage from the instructor’s handcam to determine the sequence of events on this jump and also reviewed many videos of her previous tandem skydives, which all exhibited the same unstable, rolling exit followed by a drogue throw. After the drogue entanglement, the instructor continued to try to resolve it until approximately 2,000 feet, when the AAD activated. The tandem manufacturer’s procedure for a drogue entanglement calls for the instructor to attempt to clear the entanglement for no more than 10 seconds, then deploy the reserve parachute immediately (no lower than 3,000 feet). Had she activated the reserve higher, there would have been more time and altitude available for it to clear the freebag and fully inflate. As with most fatal skydiving accidents, many factors ultimately led to the fatal outcome. In this case: • The instructor completed her initial tandem rating with an examiner who later had his rating revoked for a multitude of reasons, one of which was failing to train candidates properly on emergency procedures. Consequently, she may not have received proper initial training. • She received USPA-required retraining after her initial examiner had his rating revoked. However, she apparently did not correct her procedures and returned to the habit of performing exits improperly. • Every tandem video that investigators reviewed showed the instructor performing the same improper rolling, unstable exit with the left arm extended to capture handcam footage, then a drogue throw while the tandem pair rolled face to earth. In addition, none of the videos show her conducting a tandem-system-handles check (a USPA Basic Safety Requirement). Tandem instructors must learn and practice correct techniques and perform them properly on every tandem skydive. • Even though she demonstrated poor exit technique and routinely violated the handles-check BSR while working at several different drop zones, none of the Safety and Training Advisors or drop zone owners corrected her. • The instructor focused on getting handcam footage, which contributed to the unstable exits. Tandem instructors using handcams must prioritize tandem procedures over video procedures. • The instructor incorrectly performed emergency procedures. She should have deployed the reserve within 10 seconds after the drogue entanglement. This fatality shows the importance of following the long-established standard operating procedures for every phase of a tandem skydive. Proper initial training and certification lays the groundwork. Tandem examiners, S&TAs and drop zone owners also need to monitor tandem instructors to help ensure that they continue to adhere to standard procedures. Those procedures include a careful gear check before boarding the plane, proper harnessing of the student, a handles check before the exit, proper setup in the door and a stable launch and flyaway into the relative wind, a visual check of the drogue followed by a system-handles check, a drogue release no lower than 4,500 feet and a safe canopy descent and landing.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;No;done

The jumper was wearing a weight vest to help increase his freefall speed, since he normally fell more slowly than other jumpers. However, on this jump he dropped below the rest of the formation soon after exit and was unable to slow his fall rate enough to get back on level with it. He remained at an unreported distance below the 4-way formation for the remainder of the skydive. The formation separated at its planned altitude of 4,500 feet above the ground. One of the jumpers in the formation reported that he observed the lower jumper first moving away from the other jumpers but then back toward them prior to deploying his main parachute at approximately 4,000 feet. Investigators reported that the jumper did not have much mobility in his neck due to his age and may have had difficulty locating the jumpers above him. This jumper was directly below one of the other jumpers as his main canopy inflated. The higher jumper, who was still in freefall, struck and damaged the top skin of the lower jumper’s main canopy; tore the main pilot chute and bridle loose; severed several of the suspension lines; broke the right main riser’s locking loop, which allowed the 3-ring system to release; and then struck the jumper himself. The impact was violent, and the friction generated enough heat to melt the severed bridle onto the higher jumper’s jumpsuit, where it remained until after she landed. She continued in freefall, dazed from the impact but able to deploy her main canopy and land uneventfully despite a concussion and injuries to her hand and elbow. A witness under canopy reported seeing the lower jumper unresponsive after the collision. (He did not see the collision itself.) The jumper was hanging limp with his arms at his sides as the damaged, partially inflated main canopy descended rapidly, swinging from side to side. Witnesses on the ground—who had seen the initial uncontrolled canopy descent and expected to see an immediate cutaway but did not realize that the jumper was injured or unconscious—reported that the jumper’s reserve pilot chute launched at approximately 500-600 feet. Unfortunately, it entangled with the main canopy and stopped the deployment of the reserve. The jumper appeared to be moving his arms at this point, possibly attempting to control the main canopy or extract the reserve. He struck an asphalt surface at a high rate of descent, and the impact killed him instantly.";When this jumper sank below the formation, he remained near it as he worked to get back on level, which was the correct action. However, he appears to have lost sight of the formation at some point and became unsure of which direction to track. It is not unusual for skydivers to experience different fall rates during group skydives of any discipline. When a person goes low, all jumpers in the formation need to keep an eye on the lower jumper. The group may need to collectively increase the fall rate or even completely separate and dive down to the lower jumper and rebuild the formation. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 6-1 includes recommendations for group freefall and warns that the greatest danger exists when jumpers lose sight of each other and open independently, which may set the stage for a jumper in freefall to collide with an open canopy. Investigators also reported that this jumper typically deployed at a higher altitude than most jumpers, and on this jump he deployed at approximately 4,000 feet. Investigators did not report whether he waved off before he deployed, but he deployed directly below another jumper, which eliminated any chance for the other jumper to move toward clear airspace whether he waved off or not. The relatively high deployment of 4,000 feet increased the chance of a collision, since the jumpers above him were just beginning to break off and separate for deployment. A safer option would have been for the low jumper to continue to track in an appropriate direction and deploy at 2,500 feet. This would have given the other jumpers more time to separate horizontally from the lower jumper, allowing everyone to have clear airspace for deployment.;6.563735947131347;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;5.0;Yes;done

Investigators used the video footage to aid in the investigation. The exit and freefall were uneventful. The tandem instructor deployed his main canopy at approximately 5,000 feet, and this jumper continued in freefall for another 11 seconds, deploying his main canopy at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 2,500 feet. The main canopy opened hard and immediately began to spin rapidly to the right. After approximately four rotations, the jumper—who was spinning in a back-to-earth orientation—pulled the cutaway handle to release the main parachute. The container was not equipped with a reserve static line or main-assisted-reserve-deployment device. However, the jumper pulled his reserve ripcord almost immediately after releasing the main canopy. After the cutaway, he continued falling with his back to the earth, rotating horizontally toward the right. The reserve pilot chute and bridle deployed from under the jumper’s right side, but the bridle was caught on something behind the jumper, which stopped the deployment of the reserve parachute. Investigators could not determine what trapped the reserve bridle but speculated that it may have been his right arm or the back of his camera helmet. Although the bridle was trapped, the reserve freebag escaped from the container, and the video showed some of the reserve lines and the right reserve risers coming off the jumper’s right side. The video stopped a few seconds after the reserve activation, possibly due to the jumper or some part of the reserve system hitting the video camera. Several experienced skydivers on the ground reported that the jumper remained in freefall while trailing his reserve pilot chute for approximately eight seconds after the cutaway. The jumper struck the ground as he continued to try to clear the entanglement, and the hard impact killed him instantly. Responders found the jumper on his back with the reserve freebag nearby. Most of the reserve lines were unstowed, but the reserve canopy was still in the freebag. The reserve bridle was lying next to him but wasn’t wrapped around any part of his body or gear. Some of the reserve lines were entangled around his right wrist. The impact apparently caused the jumper’s helmet to come off, and it was found near him. The ring sight was detached, but investigators could not determine whether the bridle had been caught on the ring sight. The camera helmet was not equipped with a cutaway system.;This jumper was very current and an experienced videographer who was familiar with his parachute system and camera system. A packer under the supervision of a Federal Aviation Administration-certified rigger packed the main parachute. The jumper had complained of hard openings on both the parachute he was jumping for this jump and an identical main canopy that he used in a different parachute system. Earlier in the day, his main parachute opened hard enough that he may have suffered a broken nose during the deployment. Hard deployments occur occasionally and are usually caused by packing errors. However, repeated hard openings indicate possible problems with the parachute itself that a parachute rigger or the manufacturer should investigate. If the manufacturer or rigger cannot resolve persistent hard openings, the parachute should be destroyed and replaced. Hard parachute openings can cause severe or even fatal injuries, so it is not worth the risk to continue jumping a main parachute that opens hard for unexplained reasons. If an RSL or MARD device had activated the reserve, it may have extracted the reserve freebag from the container before the bridle had a chance to entangle with the jumper or his equipment. Although the jumper pulled the reserve ripcord almost immediately, he had already begun to rotate into the reserve bridle as the pilot chute launched. A stable, belly-to-earth body position when a jumper is executing emergency procedures can reduce the chances of a reserve entanglement. However, this jumper had no time to spare to get stable since he was under a violently spinning main parachute that was rapidly losing altitude. Many videographers choose to jump without an RSL or MARD for fear of an entanglement with the camera helmet. However, the last two reserve-bridle-entanglement fatalities have been jumpers with camera helmets who manually activated their reserves. Statistics do not indicate that there is more risk of an entanglement when using an RSL/MARD, and there are many reports of jumpers with video equipment having uneventful reserve activations while using one. In this case, the main canopy deployment was between 2,000 to 2,500 feet. Following four rapid rotations, the jumper was probably close to 1,000 feet when he released his main parachute. The minimum deployment altitude without a waiver is 2,500 feet, and a higher main deployment would have provided him more time to try to resolve the entanglement. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that students and A-licensed jumpers initiate emergency procedures by at least 2,500 feet and B- through D-licensed jumpers by 1,800 feet.;20.717411926344003;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;Yes;done

The jump also included a camera flyer, and investigators used the outside video of the skydive to assist with investigating this fatality. The student advanced to this jump, his first release jump, after his first two jumps of the day were uneventful. Following a stable exit, the student performed practice touches. At approximately 10,000 feet, both the main- and reserve-side instructors released the student. He drifted slightly to the left and right while working to maintain his heading then began a moderate turn for a few seconds before the main-side instructor re-docked on him at approximately 7,000 feet. After giving the student hand signals to arch and relax, the main-side instructor released the jumper again at just above 6,000 feet. Just after the release, the jumper waved off to indicate that he was initiating main-canopy deployment. As he reached toward the right-side main pilot chute handle with his right arm, his shoulder dislocated, and he suddenly grabbed his right arm with his left hand, holding the arm against the front of his torso. As he moved both arms toward his belly area, he began to de-arch at the waist. This caused him to pitch head down and drop away from both instructors before either had a chance to re-dock. He attempted to deploy the main again and rolled onto his back. Both instructors attempted to catch the student to assist in the main canopy deployment, but his fall rate had increased dramatically while he was spinning on his back in a de-arched body position. The student continued to attempt to pull and to arch to get stable, but he remained in a back-to-earth position and was unable to extract his pilot chute. At an unreported altitude, both instructors deployed their main parachutes. The student continued in freefall until the automatic activation device activated the reserve parachute at an unreported altitude. Investigators reported that at some point—they could not determine whether it was in freefall or after reserve deployment—the student pulled the instructor-assist handle on the left side of the bottom-of-container pilot-chute pouch. This handle opened the pilot-chute pouch and allowed the main pilot chute to escape. Witnesses in the air and on the ground observed him at a low altitude with a fully inflated reserve and a trailing main pilot chute. The main pilot chute then extracted the main canopy, which fully inflated at approximately 200 feet and formed a downplane with the reserve parachute. A few seconds later, the jumper released his main canopy. The reserve parachute did not have enough altitude to recover from the dive caused by the downplane and return to level flight, and the jumper struck the ground about one second after releasing the main. The hard landing resulted in multiple injuries, and the jumper died in the ambulance before reaching the hospital.;This jump was a relatively routine student skydive up until the student attempted to deploy the main parachute. His two previous jumps had gone well, and there were no indications that he would have any difficulties with reaching the main deployment handle or deploying his main parachute on this jump. If the student had pulled his reserve handle at a higher altitude or had not pulled the instructor-assist handle on the bottom-of-container pouch, the outcome would likely have been different. Although it’s unknown exactly when the jumper pulled the instructor-assist handle, if he had released the main parachute immediately afterward, there might have been enough altitude remaining for the reserve parachute to return to level flight before he reached the ground. However, he released the main parachute just a second or two before impact, which did not give the reserve parachute enough altitude to recover from the dive and slow the jumper’s descent rate. AFF instructors should make every attempt to stay within arm’s reach of a student to allow for quick re-docking if it becomes necessary. Attempting to catch a tumbling student is the most challenging task for any AFF instructor. The freefall speeds are usually very fast but also variable. In this case, the difficulty of catching the student increased because each time the student attempted to reach his deployment handle, the instructors needed to alter their positions to avoid colliding with the main if it deployed. In addition, a student losing stability at deployment altitude creates a worst-case scenario because the working time to catch the student is so short.;0.0845311057229295;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

Seven of the jumpers on the skydive held only A licenses. During breakoff, Jumper 1 changed her heading to avoid a nearby jumper. Another jumper (Jumper 2), who was higher, noticed this heading change, and as soon as Jumper 1 passed underneath him, he deployed his main canopy. However, Jumper 1 deployed at the same time. The two jumpers’ main canopies entangled, and they could not communicate because both wore full-face helmets. Jumper 2 released his main parachute, and his SkyHook main-assisted reserve-deployment system deployed his reserve, which opened immediately. He landed under his reserve without incident. Jumper 1 was now in a violent spin and entangled in the lines of Jumper 2’s parachute. At approximately 2,000 feet, she released her main parachute, but she remained attached to Jumper 2’s parachute, which continued to spin violently. She pulled her reserve ripcord, but the reserve pilot chute entangled with Jumper 2’s main and would not extract the reserve parachute. Jumper 1 landed hard under the entangled main parachute, sustaining broken ribs, a punctured lung and a fractured pelvis.;Jumpers should track to clear their airspace before deployment, which helps ensure that they will not collide with another jumper during the deployment. Additionally, an 8-way skydive made up entirely of skydivers with very little experience is risky for each participant. Newly licensed skydivers should participate in smaller group jumps made up of more experienced skydivers to build on basic skills before attempting larger and more complex skydives.;1.2793608133427918;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;8.0;Yes;done

The tandem instructor then deployed his reserve parachute, which cleared the entangled drogue and drogue bridle and opened fully.

The exit and freefall were uneventful. The skydivers began to separate and track away from each other at 4,800 feet above the ground. This jumper deployed his main canopy at approximately 3,000 feet while reportedly only 30 feet away from and at the same altitude as a second jumper (Jumper 2), who was also deploying. Investigators believe that neither jumper saw the other while tracking. Jumper 1’s main canopy opened with line twists and made a 90-degree turn toward the other jumper as it inflated. A few seconds after deployment, the two jumpers collided body to body and their main parachutes entangled. The damaged and entangled parachutes then began to spin with the two jumpers orbiting around the outside. Jumper 2 remained conscious after the collision, and he released his main parachute and deployed his reserve just a few seconds after the collision. Jumper 1 was either killed or knocked unconscious by the impact. Investigators reported that he was unresponsive during the entire descent under the two damaged and entangled main parachutes. His main canopy was in a moderate spin while trailing the entangled main parachute that Jumper 2 cut away. The impact caused rib injuries and significant bruising to Jumper 2. It also knocked off his helmet. After he released his main parachute and deployed his reserve, he struggled to remain focused and conscious as he descended toward the main landing area. He flared the reserve parachute at an altitude reported only as “too high,” and the parachute stalled, which resulted in a hard landing. The jumper suffered a broken lower leg from the hard landing, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Jumper 1 landed hard in a cornfield. The cutaway handle and reserve-ripcord handle were both in place on his harness, and the brakes of his main parachute were still stowed. First responders reached him almost immediately after landing, but he did not have any vital signs. Emergency personnel declared him dead at the scene.;Jumper 1 had made at least one other skydive earlier in the day. With only 22 jumps in the previous 12 months, he was technically considered a current skydiver. However, jumping more frequently will improve skills and awareness both in freefall and under canopy. The breakoff altitude of 4,800 feet provided a reasonable amount of time and altitude for experienced skydivers to track away and achieve a safe horizontal distance from each other for deployment. However, the two jumpers tracked away in similar directions and deployed 30 feet apart. It is possible that these two jumpers were oriented in such a way that neither jumper could see the other while they were tracking. However, jumpers are usually aware of who is beside them on breakoff, which helps them know who is likely to be nearby and necessary to watch for while tracking. The jumpers can also adjust their tracking directions at breakoff when necessary and should look all around them before deploying to ensure they have clear airspace. Ensuring maximum distance from other jumpers during deployment helps reduce the chance of a deployment collision. In addition, Jumper 1’s main parachute opened with line twists and off heading, which put him on a collision course with the second jumper when the main canopy inflated and surged forward. Had his parachute opened on heading, the jumpers probably would not have collided. However, line twists and off-heading openings are relatively common problems. The reasonable likelihood of having a canopy that is not immediately controllable after opening is a major reason why jumpers must gain large distances from others before deploying.;9.001684088748899;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;8.0;No;done

Investigators reported that his initial canopy descent and landing pattern were normal and uneventful. At an unknown altitude, the jumper initiated a 180-degree turn toward his final approach leg. The jumper was in a steep, diving turn that he performed too low for the canopy to return to level flight before reaching the ground. Witnesses on the ground observed the jumper pulling both toggles down in an effort to recover from the diving turn and stop the steep approach, but there was not enough altitude remaining. The jumper struck the ground hard and then advanced another 50-100 feet before coming to a stop. The hard landing caused a broken femur and severe trauma to the jumper’s torso. He received immediate medical attention, and a helicopter took him to a hospital. He died from his injuries soon after arriving at the hospital.;This jumper was reportedly current and experienced with the main canopy he was jumping, a cross-braced model that he loaded at 2:1. There was no canopy traffic that could have been a factor, and the weather was clear with light winds. Investigators reported that the jumper misjudged the height necessary for the 180-degree turn to his final approach. Although he realized he was too low and attempted to stop the diving turn by flaring with both toggles, it was too late, and he struck the ground at a high descent rate. High-performance landings leave very little room for error, even for very experienced jumpers. If a jumper starts a turn too low, there may not be enough altitude remaining to stop the high descent rate. It is possible to adjust the recovery arc or begin the recovery arc early, but corrections—even the application of a full flare to flatten the recovery arc of the canopy—will not correct a very low turn in time. Jumpers who choose to make high-performance landings must decide if the additional risk of severe injury or death is worth the excitement. Jumpers must complete all turns with enough altitude remaining to return to level flight for the landing flare.;20.86825516761252;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

The pilot reported that the exit was uneventful but did not witness anything afterward, and there was no video of the exit or freefall. However, the instructor evidently deployed the drogue after the exit. An experienced tandem instructor on the ground observed the tandem pair under the reserve canopy at an altitude reported only as “low.” The drogue trailed behind the tandem pair as they descended under the reserve parachute. The pair descended in a straight path then disappeared from the view of the ground witness behind a line of trees. They landed on a golf course fairway clear of any obstacles. When first responders arrived, they found the tandem instructor unconscious and the student conscious and complaining of pain in her back. The tandem instructor did not respond to care, and emergency personnel declared him dead at the scene. A helicopter transported the student to a local hospital, which determined she had minor injuries and released her.;An experienced tandem instructor arrived at the accident site soon after the pair landed. He observed that the drogue was deployed, the drogue release handles were in place, the automatic activation device’s cutter activated and cut the reserve closing loop, and the reserve parachute steering toggles were still stowed. Based on this evidence, investigators determined that the instructor exited, deployed the drogue and died while the pair was in droguefall. The AAD-activated reserve parachute cleared the drogue and inflated normally. The coroner reported that the tandem instructor died from coronary heart disease. The instructor held a current Federal Aviation Administration Third-Class Medical Certificate, which is required to hold a USPA Tandem Instructor rating. While the exam for the third-class medical does include a thorough checkup, detecting some coronary conditions requires more extensive testing. Jumpers who may be at risk of coronary heart disease should discuss the issue with a medical professional.;27.667072174394203;Yes;Yes;No;tandem;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;No;done

Investigators reported that video of the skydive showed the jumper beginning to break off from the skydive at 5,500 feet, then rolling onto his back and starting to spin. At approximately 2,000 feet, he pulled his cutaway handle and deployed his reserve parachute while still falling back to earth. Other jumpers in the air at the time reported that the reserve parachute opened fully without any line twists but turned for the entire descent. The jumper did not deploy his main pilot chute, which investigators later found stowed but easy to extract from the pouch (indicating that the jumper did not attempt to deploy his main canopy). The automatic activation device did not activate the cutter, and the reserve closing loop was intact. The steering toggles on the reserve were still in the stowed position. The jumper landed in a reservoir. Responders pulled him from the water approximately five minutes after he landed. The first responders administered first aid, but he did not respond to the resuscitation efforts. The coroner found no water in his lungs—which indicated that he was not breathing when he entered the water—and determined that he died of a heart attack, probably while descending under his reserve parachute.;Since the jump was uneventful until the jumper began to tumble on his back, that is likely when he experienced the heart attack. While in this back-to-earth position at 2,000 feet, he chose to deploy his reserve parachute rather than his main, which was the right decision since a reserve is more likely to open without a malfunction. Pulling the cutaway handle was not necessary (because there was nothing deployed to cut away), but the decision to do so had no effect on the outcome of this incident. Although the emergency procedure portion of Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends pulling the reserve ripcord alone in the event of a total malfunction, some jumpers choose to always pull the cutaway handle and practice their emergency procedures this way. Once the reserve deployed, the jumper was apparently incapacitated to the point where he was either unconscious or unable to respond. The canopy was in a turn (even though it was fully inflated and had no line twists), possibly because the jumper was unconscious and leaning to one side in the harness, loading that side more heavily. Investigators reported that this jumper stopped jumping the previous day because he did not feel well. However, he returned to the drop zone on the day of the incident to continue skydiving. As the jumping population continues to get older, more jumpers are at risk of experiencing a medical emergency during a skydive. Most medical professionals recommend a regular medical check-up at least once a year, especially for people over 40 years of age.;16.934526274062105;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;No;5.0;No;done

Jumpers on the ground observed him flying a normal descent under canopy. At some point after opening, he stowed the slider for his main canopy behind his head and neck, which is a common practice. While flying the base leg of his landing pattern, he made several minor heading changes, and at 150 feet above the ground, he initiated a front-riser turn to the left toward his final approach. Almost immediately after completing the turn, he pulled down both toggles to apply brakes, apparently immediately realizing that he had initiated the turn too low and that the canopy was diving toward the ground without enough altitude remaining for the recovery arc. In addition, the jumper’s slider dislodged from behind his neck and appeared to briefly catch on the camera mount on the front of his helmet as he initiated the front-riser turn, which may have blocked his view and distracted him. The jumper struck the ground hard while the canopy was in a steep descent. His feet and knees made impact first, then his chest and head, and he traveled for another 30-40 feet before coming to a stop. He broke multiple bones and sustained a severe head injury during the landing. He received immediate medical attention and transport to a hospital where he died several days later from his injuries.;Although the low turn seems to be the main cause of this accident, the slider dislodging from behind the jumper’s neck and briefly snagging on the front-mounted camera may have played a part. If jumpers opt to stow their sliders by pulling them down to the bottom of the risers, twisting them up and putting them behind their necks, they must maintain a slight pressure against them with their necks or otherwise ensure that they do not catch air and dislodge. In addition, jumpers need to be aware that camera mounts can easily snag sliders, risers and steering lines. Jumpers must use care to ensure that equipment entanglement does not occur at any point during the skydive or canopy descent. Once this jumper realized that he initiated his turn too low, he attempted to slow the descent rate by pulling both toggles down to his shoulders, which had little effect on the canopy before he struck the ground. A better response in this situation may have been to flare harder to a full-flare position. Jumpers must complete all turns with enough altitude for the canopy to return to level flight for the landing flare.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

Both the freefall and initial canopy descent were uneventful. Witnesses in the air and on the ground reported seeing this jumper flying his canopy normally, although he was in heavy canopy traffic with many parachutes landing in the same general area. He was in straight-and-level flight during his final approach, but his canopy turned quickly to the right when he was approximately 20 feet above the ground. None of the witnesses observed the jumper make any input (such as pulling the right toggle down) that would have caused the turn. He struck the ground in a hard diving turn just a second or two after the turn started. The temperature on the ground was 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the density altitude was 4,600 feet. The hot temperatures and high density altitude may have been a factor if the air just above the ground was rising and unstable or developing into a dust devil. The hard landing resulted in multiple serious injuries including broken bones, internal injuries and a head injury. He received immediate first aid and was airlifted to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries.;Investigators could not determine the exact cause of the abrupt right turn. A spectator on the ground a long distance away from the jumper caught the landing on a cell-phone video, but it did not provide much detail. Without a close eyewitness or clear video of the final canopy descent, investigators could only speculate on the exact cause of the turn. Investigators speculated that the jumper may have dropped a toggle just before flaring the canopy, experienced wake turbulence from a nearby canopy, encountered turbulent air from a dust devil or even had a medical emergency. Each of these situations has caused fatal accidents in the past, but investigators could not pinpoint whether one of them was a factor in this case. This jumper was flying a cross-braced canopy at a wing loading of 2.5:1. At such a high wing loading, landing in a turning descent without flaring the canopy is generally not survivable. The higher the wing loading, the faster the forward speed and descent rate, which increases the chances of an injury or fatality from an uncontrolled landing. Had this jumper been on a larger canopy at a lighter wing loading, the injuries may have been less severe and the landing may have been survivable.;24.70254082420924;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;Yes;81.0;No;done

A spare altimeter was in the airplane, so he set it to what the other jumpers’ altimeters read. His exit and freefall went as planned, and he deployed his main canopy at an unreported altitude. Under canopy, the jumper was used to using his altimeter to judge when to make turns in his landing pattern. When the altimeter read 500 feet, he attempted a 180-degree turn toward final approach for his landing. However, he was only 50-100 feet above the ground. He landed hard on a concrete taxiway, bruising his hip and tailbone.;Jumpers should learn to judge height above the ground visually and use the altimeter as a confirmation of the visual determination.

M2;Yes;Yes, unreported type;installed   not known if connected;No;;This jumper exited a Cessna 182 from 5,000 feet with a plan to immediately deploy his main parachute. Investigators reported that no one witnessed his deployment or descent. When drop zone staff noticed he had not returned from his jump, they began looking for him. They located him not long afterward and found that he had struck the ground with the main parachute released and the reserve parachute undeployed. First responders who arrived with the ambulance determined that the hard impact killed him instantly. At some point during the descent, the jumper pulled his cutaway handle and released the main parachute. Investigators found the main parachute only 30 feet east and the cutaway handle only 60 feet southeast of his body. The jumper did not pull his reserve ripcord handle, and investigators found the reserve container closed with the reserve ripcord pin through the reserve closing loop. The container was equipped with a reserve static line, but the shackle was open. This detached the RSL from the main risers and eliminated its ability to pull the reserve ripcord as the main risers detached from the harness.;With no witnesses, the investigators did not have much information to help with the investigation. However, the close proximity of the main parachute and cutaway handle to the jumper on the ground suggests that he released the main canopy at a very low altitude. However, with no witnesses in the air or on the ground, it is impossible to determine the exact altitude at which he released the main parachute. Investigators assumed that the main parachute had a malfunction and that the jumper did not pull the cutaway handle until he was at a very low altitude. They were unable to determine why he did not pull his reserve ripcord handle. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 4 recommends that jumpers locate their reserve ripcord handles before pulling their cutaway handles to help ensure that they pull their reserve handles as quickly as possible after their cutaways. This jumper’s reserve static line was not connected to the main riser, which prevented it from pulling the reserve ripcord as the main risers detached from the harness. Even if the RSL pulled the reserve immediately—or if the jumper pulled the reserve ripcord immediately—after the cutaway, he may still have been too low for the reserve parachute to fully inflate. SIM Section 5-1 recommends that students and A-license holders initiate emergency procedures by at least 2,500 feet above the ground and B- through D-license holders by at least 1,800 feet. The rig contained an automatic activation device, but there was not enough altitude remaining after the cutaway for the device to activate. AADs are primarily designed to activate if a jumper has remained in freefall while passing through the activation altitude. AADs are not designed to work as back-up devices following cutaways (although if a jumper performs a cutaway high enough, an AAD may re-arm and activate the reserve with enough altitude for full inflation of the reserve). Incident Addendum The October 2017 issue of Parachutist included an “Incident Report” about a jumper who died after he released his main parachute at a very low altitude and failed to deploy his reserve. After publishing the report, USPA received additional information that helped to identify the cause of the low cutaway. In the original report, investigators assumed that the main parachute had malfunctioned in some way but could not determine why the jumper released it. The cause of the incident became apparent after investigators sent the deceased jumper’s Mirage G4 harness and container to the manufacturer for an inspection. Mirage personnel determined that the cutaway handle was not a factory original and that the cutaway cable for the left riser was much too short for the harness and container. Even though the cable extended out of the housing far enough to pass through the locking loop of the riser, there was barely any excess cable extending past the loop. Simply flexing the harness could pull the cable enough to release the left riser. It’s probable that this jumper shifted his weight in the harness in such a way that the left cutaway cable pulled free from the locking loop on the riser, releasing the left riser, and that he then pulled his cutaway handle to initiate emergency procedures but did not have enough altitude remaining to pull the reserve ripcord before he struck the ground. Investigators reported that this jumper had recently bought and sold a lot of used skydiving gear and frequently swapped out canopies and cutaway handles. However, he was not a parachute rigger and may not have realized the left cutaway cable was dangerously short for this harness-and-container system. Jumpers should always seek the advice of a trained and certified parachute rigger for equipment-related issues.;12.209408133296536;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

The coach and another jumper in the 4-way separated and deployed early to watch this jumper’s descent and landing, and they observed him deploy his main canopy at approximately 5,000 feet. They reported that the right side of the jumper’s main canopy did not fully inflate and that he entered a slow spiral in an unreported direction. He did not appear to take action to stop the turn or perform emergency procedures for most of his descent. He finally released his main parachute and deployed his reserve at an altitude reported only as “very low.” (The investigators did not provide an estimated height.) The two jumpers who watched his descent from above reported that the jumper made one 90-degree left turn and landed in a pond near the airport after an estimated two-second descent under his reserve parachute. After he landed in the pond, the other two jumpers were still under canopy directly above him. Both jumpers spiraled under canopy to land as soon as possible, and during their descents they observed the jumper come to the surface immediately after landing, but he appeared to be struggling. He then slipped below the surface and did not reappear. The two jumpers landed a minute or two later, pulled him out and attempted to revive him, but he did not respond to first aid. The coroner later reported that the cause of death was drowning.;Investigators found the main canopy with both brakes stowed but did not find either the cutaway or reserve-ripcord handle. It is unknown why the jumper never attempted to release the main canopy’s brakes or perform a control check. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that students and A-license holders initiate emergency procedures by at least 2,500 feet. No one knows why this jumper did not initiate emergency procedures until much lower, leaving him with just a few seconds under the reserve before landing. The pond was surrounded by open, grassy areas. If the jumper had flown the canopy straight, he would have landed in grass. Investigators found the reserve parachute’s left brake released but the right brake still stowed. This could explain why the jumper made a 90-degree turn just before landing. The jumper may have attempted to release both brakes but released only one side, which would cause the parachute to turn (unless he held the released brake down to match the stowed brake). The reserve toggles on this system attached to the risers using Velcro. It is possible that the Velcro held firm and that the jumper’s right hand slipped out of the toggle while the left brake released. Most main risers no longer use Velcro, so jumpers are not used to working with it. Especially when Velcro is in new condition (which is common on reserve risers), it will hold the toggle firmly in place and the jumper must peel the toggle off the riser. If the jumper pulls the toggle with a shearing motion, it takes much more force to free. Regardless of the reason for the turn, it pointed him directly toward the pond during the last seconds of his descent, leaving him with no time to prepare for a water landing or think about what he should do once he entered the water. Immediately after the jumper descended into the water, he had trouble staying above the surface. Investigators reported that he was badly entangled in the suspension lines of the reserve canopy. It is easy to become entangled with suspension lines while treading water because the lines wrap around the jumper’s arms and legs as he kicks and paddles. In this case, the jumper was unable to remain above the surface for very much time. He was also wearing a full-face helmet, which may have made it even more difficult to breathe once he entered the water. Skydiver’s Information Manual Sections 5-1 and 6-5 contain water-landing recommendations. If a jumper lands in the water under the main parachute, the SIM recommends disconnecting the reserve static line and preparing to cut away the main canopy. If landing under a reserve, the jumper must get out of the harness to get away from the suspension lines. The SIM also recommends that jumpers remove any full-coverage helmets to help with breathing. This jumper quickly entangled with his reserve parachute lines, which prevented him from escaping from the harness so he could tread water and swim to the edge of the pond. With only 19 jumps, it is likely this jumper had not yet gone through water training, which is a requirement for the USPA B license. According to the USPA Basic Safety Requirements, all solo students must wear floatation gear when the intended exit, opening or landing point is within one mile of an open body of water (defined as one in which a skydiver could drown). This BSR is waiverable by a drop zone Safety and Training Advisor. This drop zone was not a USPA Group Member. However, the BSRs apply to each individual USPA member, no matter where the skydive occurs.

Just before boarding, they decided to switch the exit to a sit-fly-train exit, in which all three jumpers faced the tail of the airplane and exited linked with their legs gripping the sides of the jumpers ahead of them. The middle jumper’s main-pin flap came loose during the climb out, exposing the bridle to the relative wind. As the three jumpers exited, the jumper in the rear dropped off immediately, and a few seconds later the center jumper experienced a main canopy deployment. Investigators could not determine whether the exposed bridle had led to the pilot chute extraction or if the jumper in the rear caught the pilot chute with his foot during the exit. The main-pin flap on this student container frequently came loose, and the pilot chute pouch was a dual-sided releasable design used for student gear.;Jumpers who are attempting anything new in skydiving should seek out the advice of more experienced skydivers and coaches for the specific discipline and use appropriate gear for the jump.

The jumper’s exit, freefall and initial canopy descent were uneventful. During her final approach, she pulled down on both front risers to increase her forward speed and descent rate. Another jumper was on her left side, flying in the same direction. Investigators reported that the two canopies were converging slightly but not enough to collide. The report did not indicate how much distance was between the two canopy pilots. This jumper looked at the canopy to her left while continuing to pull down on both front risers. Investigators reported that she continued to look at the jumper to her left but let up on her front risers just before she stuck the ground. The jumper struck the ground in a steep descent without flaring the canopy for landing. She contacted the ground with her feet and knees, followed by her head. Investigators reported that the hard landing caused severe head trauma but did not indicate whether the jumper sustained any other injuries. She received immediate first aid and was airlifted to a local hospital, where she died of her head injury.;This jumper wore a camera, which allowed investigators to determine what occurred during the canopy descent and landing. On final approach, she fixated on the canopy to her left, seemingly to make sure the two canopies remained on parallel paths. Apparently, the jumper lost track of her altitude and did not notice that she was so close to the ground. Just before she struck the ground, she released her front risers, presumably to begin her landing flare, but struck the ground without flaring the parachute. Busy landing areas can result in two or more jumpers flying parallel flight paths on final approach. It is unknown whether this jumper normally used her front risers to increase her forward speed and descent rate for landing or whether she was attempting to adjust her spacing with the other canopy. Regardless, she put too much focus on the other jumper during the final approach and not on the rapidly approaching ground. Maintaining separation from others under canopy is a critical task for every jumper. However, it is equally important to continue scanning in all directions and to flare the parachute for landing at the correct height above the ground.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;2.0;No;done

It was her second jump of the day. The exit and freefall were uneventful. The instructor reported that the student’s deployment at 5,000 feet appeared normal and that he then continued in freefall and opened at a lower altitude. Witnesses on the ground observed the student’s canopy flying away from the drop zone landing area and reported that the student was not responding to radio commands. A drop zone staff member followed the canopy by car, intending to pick up the student after she landed. The staff member discovered the parachute system in a small tree approximately five miles from the drop zone, but the harness was empty and the jumper was nowhere to be seen. The main canopy was fully spread open across the branches of the tree with all the suspension lines attached to the main risers. The slider was all the way down to the risers. The harness-and-container system was attached to the main risers. The chest strap and leg straps were fully adjusted with the excess webbing stowed. The rig had an optional belly band installed, but it was unthreaded from its friction adapter. Several staff members reported that the jumper received multiple gear checks before both boarding the plane and exiting for the skydive and that the belly band was threaded and adjusted properly. The next day, investigators found the jumper’s body approximately four miles from the location of the parachute system and approximately a mile away from the spot where the instructor observed her deploy her main parachute. These distances indicate that she came out of the harness at a fairly high altitude, probably not long after deployment. She died instantly after striking the ground at high speed.;Investigators, including inspectors from the Federal Aviation Administration Flight Standards District Office and an FAA Master Rigger, inspected the harness and container and found the equipment to be in good condition with no damage or defects. They placed a woman similar in height and weight to the student in the harness and suspended it by the risers. The harness fit correctly. Investigators could not determine how the student came out of the harness with the chest strap, leg straps and belly band threaded and adjusted properly. They then disconnected the belly band, and although it was very difficult, the woman in the hanging harness forced herself from the harness by bending at the waist and sliding backward out of the leg straps, passing underneath the container. With this information, investigators reported that they were unable to conclusively determine how the jumper separated from the harness.;0.1244901225641942;Yes;Yes;No;student;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;2.0;No;done

The jumper initiated emergency procedures just as the main canopy began to deploy. The reserve fully inflated. The main canopy also inflated and remained attached to the harness by one riser because the cutaway was incomplete. The jumper landed under the reserve canopy uneventfully while still towing the partially inflated main canopy.;Low-speed exits can sometimes cause a hesitation of the main-canopy deployment if the closing loop is tight.

This caused her to track underneath another jumper on the formation (jumper 2). Jumper 2 saw jumper 1 passing below him, so he elected to deploy his main canopy. Jumper 1 deployed her main canopy at nearly the same time. The two jumpers became entangled and could not communicate with each other because both were wearing full-face helmets. Jumper 2 was lower, and he elected to cut away. His SkyHook main-assisted reserve deployment device deployed the reserve immediately, and he landed under it without incident. Jumper 1 was now in a violent spin under her malfunctioned main canopy and still entangled in the other partially inflated main canopy. At 2,000 feet, she pulled her cutaway handle and the main canopy completely released from the harness, but her body remained entangled with jumper 2’s cutaway main. Her reserve static line had apparently disconnected during the collision so the reserve did not deploy when she released her main canopy. She pulled her reserve ripcord at approximately 1,000 feet, but the reserve pilot chute entangled with jumper 2’s cutaway main canopy and the reserve did not deploy. She continued spinning under the partially inflated main until she struck the ground. The hard landing resulted in broken ribs, a punctured lung and a fractured pelvis. She was airlifted to a hospital for medical care.;With only 32 jumps over the course of a year, this jumper may have been overwhelmed participating in an 8-way formation. Even if the other seven skydivers were highly experienced, the new jumper may have found it difficult to safely manage the challenges of both freefall and tracking to find clear airspace on such a busy skydive. Jumpers must track to clear airspace to avoid experiencing a deployment collision. The reserve container must be clear of any suspension lines to ensure clear airspace for the reserve deployment.;1.251667866349456;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;8.0;Yes;done

An experienced skydiver on the ground who witnessed the deployment stated that the jumper’s deployment altitude seemed to be too low for him to make it to the main landing area. Other witnesses on the ground reported that he flew past an area that jumpers commonly use as an alternate landing area and continued to fly toward the main landing area. Witnesses on the ground reported that, as the jumper approached the main landing area, he made a 90-degree left turn, possibly in an effort to land crosswind rather than downwind. He initiated the turn at a low altitude and barely cleared power lines by picking up his legs as he crossed over them. However, once he cleared the power lines, his body struck a tree while he was still approximately 40 feet above the ground. The impact with the tree stopped his body from continuing forward for a second or two, and the canopy started to deflate before his body cleared the tree branches. He then dropped rapidly under the partially inflated canopy, the nose of which now pointed directly at the ground. He struck the ground hard in a steep and rapid descent at the same time as the nose of the canopy. He received immediate medical attention, but the hard impact with the ground killed him instantly.;This jumper was making a currency jump using borrowed equipment and a 150-square-foot main canopy. Investigators reported that he had previous experience flying a canopy of this size but did not report whether it was the same or a different model. They also reported that he had jumped at the drop zone in the past and that he went through refresher training that included a review of the drop zone landing area, as well as the surrounding area. Although he had completed more than 5,000 jumps since he started skydiving more than 30 years ago, he had jumped infrequently in recent years. The jumper deployed his main canopy at 2,500 feet but was too far from the main landing area to safely make it back. Checking the spot while in freefall can help jumpers decide whether to break off and deploy higher (if it is safe to do so) to provide more altitude under canopy to make it back to the main landing area. Investigators reported that he could have reached an alternate field provided he made the decision to fly to it by 1,500 feet. Once he passed that point and decided to head to the main landing area, his only other options were to land in the ocean or in a congested area containing trees and houses. He may have continued toward the drop zone out of concern over damaging his borrowed gear in an off-field landing, since the gear was nearly new. By adjusting his heading slightly, the jumper may have been able to land in a downwind direction into the main landing area. However, in a possible attempt to land crosswind rather than downwind, he approached the landing area just off to one side, which set him up for a left-hand turn at a low altitude. Once he made the turn, he had to raise his legs to clear a power line but then struck a tree. He may have been focusing on clearing the power line and not realized that he was pointed at the tree. It’s also possible that the wind pushed him toward the tree and he didn’t counter the drift with left toggle input. In any case, he struck the tree, which caused a hard landing and fatal injuries.;17.271599157912554;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;2.0;No;done

The pair planned to fly face to face, with one jumper back flying and the other above him belly flying, and switch slots during the skydive. Investigators reported that the two jumpers collided at 7,000 feet, and this jumper struck the other jumper in the leg with enough force to knock himself unconscious. He then continued in freefall in a back-to-earth orientation until his automatic activation device activated the cutter and initiated reserve parachute deployment. The reserve fully inflated but began a right-hand turn, which continued until the jumper struck the ground approximately a mile away from the drop zone. The other jumper landed nearby, and soon after he landed, personnel from the drop zone arrived and began to administer first aid. The hard landing under the turning reserve parachute caused head injuries in addition to those the jumper sustained during the collision, as well as a broken femur. He was taken by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his head injuries.;Investigators reported that this jumper had made 350 skydives, but they did not know his or the other jumper’s experience with flying a wingsuit. However, these two jumpers planned a wingsuit flight that was apparently beyond the abilities of one or both of them. The manufacturer of the wingsuit used on this jump states that it is an intermediate-level wingsuit but does not provide recommendations for the specific number of wingsuit jumps a skydiver should have before using it. To help reduce the risks as much as possible, an experienced wingsuit flyer should train and supervise wingsuit jumpers who are advancing to more complex maneuvers. Each wingsuit flyer needs to have enough skill and experience to be able to adjust direction and fall rate to avoid a collision during the maneuvers they attempt. A wingsuit flyer cannot use his arms to protect his head during a collision because the wingsuit restricts arm movement to the sides, which increases the chance of a head injury. Though this jumper was wearing a helmet and the two jumpers were flying close to one another, the impact still generated enough energy to render the jumper unconscious. A Federal Aviation Administration Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner inspected the equipment and found left-side suspension line damage and the left brake released on the reserve parachute. He determined that the back-to-earth reserve deployment caused the damage and premature brake release. With the left brake released and the right brake stowed, the parachute descended in a right turn. Because the jumper was unconscious for the entire canopy descent, he could not release the right brake to stop the turn or flare the canopy for landing. A larger reserve parachute would have provided a slower descent rate and possibly led to less severe injuries.;3.1743143421897617;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;Yes;done

A witness on the airplane reported that the jumper threw her main pilot chute as soon as she exited and that the pilot chute inflated and the bridle fully extended, but the main parachute did not come out of the container. The jumper continued in freefall with a pilot-chute-in-tow until she pulled her reserve ripcord at an unreported altitude. The witness reported that the jumper’s reserve opened very quickly, but he did not watch her descent after that, because he assumed that she would land uneventfully under her reserve parachute. Witnesses on the ground reported that the jumper’s main canopy deployed soon after the reserve, and the two canopies began flying in a side-by-side configuration. Witnesses on the ground reported that the jumper continued her descent under the two canopies flying side-by-side until the main and reserve canopies formed a downplane at a low altitude. This caused the canopies to point toward the ground and the descent speed to increase. No one nearby witnessed the landing, but the 182 pilot saw it from the plane and reported that she landed hard and created a cloud of dust. The landing resulted in the jumper breaking her leg and tearing her aorta, and although she received immediate medical attention, she died from her injuries.;The main container opened soon after the reserve deployed, which is common for this type of malfunction. However, investigators did not report whether anyone identified the cause of the pilot-chute-in-tow. The main bridle may have been misrouted or the main pilot chute may have been worn to the point where it was not producing much drag. Additionally, throwing the main pilot chute immediately after exiting from an airplane flying at exit speeds of around 80 mph can cause a pilot chute to be towed until the jumper’s airspeed picks up enough to increase drag and pull the main pin. Routing the bridle correctly, replacing a worn pilot chute and delaying the main deployment for a few seconds during a hop-and-pop can help prevent pilot-chute-in-tow malfunctions. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 includes two possible choices as a response to a pilot-chute-in-tow malfunction: “Pilot-chute-in-tow procedure 1: Pull the reserve immediately. A pilot-chute-in-tow malfunction is associated with a high descent rate and requires immediate action. The chance of a main-reserve entanglement is slim, and valuable time and altitude could be lost by initiating a cutaway prior to deploying the reserve. Be prepared to cut away. Pilot-chute-in-tow procedure 2: Cut away, then immediately deploy the reserve. Because there is a chance the main parachute could deploy during or as a result of the reserve activation, a cutaway might be the best response in some situations.” In this case, the main and reserve opened into a side-by-side formation. The jumper decided to land under the two parachutes rather than release the main and descend under the reserve, probably because the two canopies were initially flying stably. However, at a low altitude the two canopies formed a downplane, which may have occurred because the jumper attempted to steer one of the canopies. Investigators did not report whether the brakes on either canopy were released. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 lists general guidelines for dealing with dual deployments. For a side-by-side configuration, it states the following: “4. Stable side-by-side (choose one procedure): a. Side-by-side procedure 1: If both canopies are flying without interference or possibility of entanglement and altitude permits: (1) Disconnect the RSL [reserve static line]. (2) Cut away the main and steer the reserve to a normal landing. b. Side-by-side procedure 2: Land both canopies. (1) Release the brakes of the dominant canopy (larger and more overhead) and steer gently with the toggles or leave the brakes stowed and steer by pulling on the rear risers. (2) Land without flaring and perform a parachute landing fall. 5. Downplane or pinwheel a. Disconnect the reserve static line if altitude permits. b. Cut away the main canopy and steer the reserve to a normal landing.” Pilot-chute-in-tow malfunctions and dual deployments are two of the most complicated malfunctions a jumper can face. A correct response varies based on the equipment and the specific configuration of the container and canopies. Careful packing and regular maintenance can help jumpers avoid having to deal with these types of complex emergency procedures.;11.040292940241722;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

This jumper deployed his main parachute at 1,700 feet, which was 800 feet lower than the 2,500-foot minimum deployment altitude required for B- through D-license holders. The main canopy began to spin in an unreported direction immediately after the canopy inflated. Data retrieved from the automatic activation device showed that the spinning continued for eight seconds as the jumper rapidly lost altitude. He released the main canopy by pulling the cutaway handle at approximately 250 feet and continued in freefall until he struck the surface of a parking lot at a high speed. Investigators reported that the impact was very violent. The reserve parachute deployed when the jumper struck the ground, which is not unusual when the impact is this strong. Investigators located the jumper’s cutaway handle 140 feet away from his body and found the main canopy 400 feet from his body. The canopy had one brake released and the other stowed, which explains why the main canopy was spinning.;The 3-way separated at 4,500 feet, which is a common breakoff altitude for smaller formation skydiving groups. A 4,500-foot breakoff allows plenty of time for the jumpers to track for separation and still deploy at or above the minimum deployment altitudes of 3,000 feet for A-license holders and 2,500 feet for B- through D-license holders. Investigators could not determine why this jumper deployed at 1,700 feet, but the low deployment cost him valuable altitude that he could have used for his reserve deployment. His main canopy began to spin after deployment due to one brake releasing, probably during the deployment. Investigators did not report on the condition of the harness and container. A packing error or worn toggles and keepers on the main risers are the usual causes of premature brake release. Jumpers need to pack carefully and maintain their risers to help ensure the brakes remain properly stowed and the brake lines work correctly. The jumper remained with the spinning main canopy for eight seconds, losing nearly 1,500 feet before he released the main canopy. Most likely, pulling down on both toggles would have released the stowed brake on the one riser and stopped the spin. However, at such a low deployment altitude, he had no time to waste attempting to fix the problem with the main canopy and should have immediately initiated emergency procedures. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 states that at some point during descent under a partial malfunction, it becomes too low for a safe cutaway and the jumper must deploy the reserve without cutting away. The jumper’s container was equipped with a reserve static line, and although investigators found it still attached to the container, the snap shackle was open. Investigators reported that the jumper mentioned to his rigger that the snap shackle would continually open on its own. However, he did not leave the rig with his rigger to have it repaired. Although the RSL is a valuable back-up device that can help ensure the reserve parachute activates immediately after a cutaway, jumpers should not rely on it to activate the reserve and must pull the reserve handle immediately after releasing the main canopy. The container was equipped with an AAD, but an AAD is not designed to activate the reserve after the jumper releases the main canopy. At 250 feet, there was not enough altitude remaining for the AAD to determine that the jumper was back in freefall and activate the cutter. The cutter wire was severed (probably as a result of the impact) near where it attached to the cutter, but investigators could not find the cutter after an extensive search. The AAD showed an error code indicating that the cutter was not attached. This fatality was the result of several errors that combined to create a fatal outcome. Removing any one of the errors may have changed the outcome and prevented the fatality. Jumpers need to remain altitude aware, deploy at the correct altitude and be ready to initiate emergency procedures while there is still enough altitude remaining to safely deploy a reserve canopy.;2.9815165924002835;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;3.0;No;done

Investigators did not report the direction of the turn or whether the jumper initiated it with steering toggles or risers. The jumper initiated the turn too low for the canopy to return to level flight on its own before reaching the ground but did not appear to try to pull the canopy out of the diving turn with toggle or rear-riser input. Witnesses on the ground observed him in a steep dive until he struck the ground at a high speed. He received immediate medical attention but had severe head injuries and trauma to the torso, and emergency personnel pronounced him dead at the scene.;Investigators reported that this jumper had a nearly identical accident that resulted in severe injuries two years earlier but eventually recovered and resumed skydiving. Upon his return to the sport, he continued to make high-performance landings, but investigators reported that he appeared to be using correct technique, and no one raised concerns. Investigators did not report whether the jumper ever received structured training with a canopy coach, which can help reduce the risk of being injured or killed while attempting high-performance landings. With just five years and 890 jumps, most industry experts would consider this jumper to be relatively inexperienced when it comes to high-performance canopy flight. For unknown reasons, the jumper started the turn at a relatively low altitude of 500 feet and failed to realize that the he was too low to complete the turn safely. He might not have recognized that he initiated the turn too low and therefore never took any action to recover to level flight (such as stopping the turn early or immediately flaring with both toggles while there was still enough altitude remaining). In addition to having a thorough understanding of canopy flight fundamentals, jumpers who attempt high-performance landings must also possess excellent hand-eye coordination and apply it on every landing. Jumpers who choose to jump small, highly loaded canopies and execute high-performance landings are increasing the chances of being injured or killed on every landing in the event of pilot error or equipment failure. Jumpers must complete all turns under canopy with enough altitude for the canopy to return to straight and level flight for the landing flare.;6.93373722364435;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

At approximately 400 feet, as the canopy began to fly through its recovery arc, witnesses on the ground reported that the canopy partially collapsed on one side, resulting in an uncontrollable spin. Investigators reported that two of the left front suspension lines snapped, causing the canopy to deform and partially collapse. The jumper did not have enough time or altitude to cut away and deploy his reserve but attempted to regain control of the canopy with riser input. However, he struck the ground hard at a very high descent rate with the canopy still in an uncontrolled spin just a few seconds after the suspension lines snapped. He received immediate first aid, but the hard impact caused a broken neck and severe trauma to his torso and killed him instantly.;This jumper was a very current skydiver who completed 1,500 jumps in the previous year and 5,700 jumps total. He made thousands of jumps on small, cross-braced canopies (ranging in size from 94 square feet to 69 square feet) and more than 500 jumps on this canopy. He initiated his high-performance turn at the appropriate height, and investigators observed him flying the canopy with front-riser input through the 360-degree turn. The two suspension lines on the left front riser snapped when the G-forces on the canopy and suspension lines were at their highest point during the descent, which was when the canopy began to pull out of the dive through its recovery arc. In most cases, jumpers who have lower wing loadings and are flying standard patterns will experience any suspension line failure during the deployment and initial inflation of the canopy, which is typically when the canopy and suspension lines experience the highest loading. However, small, highly loaded canopies place a higher load on the suspension lines during an aggressive landing maneuver than during the deployment. In several past accidents, jumpers flying small, highly wing-loaded canopies experienced broken suspension lines while their canopies flew through their recovery arcs on final approach. Similarly, this jumper’s suspension lines remained intact during the deployment but snapped during the final approach because of the higher load on them at that time. Investigators who inspected the gear reported that the two outer suspension lines on the left front riser broke due to excessive wear at the riser end where the lines attached to the soft link. The canopy was equipped with high-modulus aramid (HMA) 400 suspension lines, which are thin suspension lines designed to reduce drag and increase canopy performance. This equipment requires users to change their lines frequently, because HMA lines are very thin and more vulnerable to failure than thicker suspension lines. Investigators believe that this jumper made more than 500 jumps on this line set. Most industry experts state that jumpers should make no more than 100 to 300 jumps on the smaller sizes of HMA suspension lines and must give them frequent, thorough inspections. Finally, as canopies become more specialized, each jumper needs to decide whether it is necessary or even practical to purchase and fly the most advanced high-performance canopies outside of the canopy piloting competition environment. Ultra-high-performance canopy flight demands ultra-high-performance maintenance and training schedules. For the average jumper, it is not practical to change suspension lines every 100 to 300 jumps. The temptation to ignore these recommendations and continue to jump the equipment past the recommended replacement schedules can lead to dangerous situations that result in death or serious injury.;44.4060336288279;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

He had completed approximately 200 military jumps more than 16 years earlier, but the investigators did not report whether the military jumps included freefall or if they were all static-line jumps. The report also stated that this jumper progressed normally through his training but had problems reaching his bottom-of-container-mounted pilot chute handle on several jumps. However, he did successfully deploy his main parachute on all of his previous jumps despite having difficulty reaching the handle. He exited the airplane with a USPA Coach on this jump, performing a non-gripped exit while the coach observed the skydive. The jumper tumbled briefly during the exit but recovered quickly, and his freefall continued uneventfully until deployment. At approximately 4,000 feet, he reached for his main pilot chute handle and flipped forward as he deployed, possibly rolling through the risers and lines of the main canopy. The coach, as well as several experienced skydivers on the ground, observed him under a spinning main parachute following the deployment. One experienced skydiver stated that the canopy was mostly inflated and spinning and looked like it had some sort of line-over malfunction. While still in a spin, the jumper struck the ground at nearly the same time as the canopy. First responders reached him very quickly. He was airlifted to a hospital but died from his multiple injuries.;Investigators were able to make a cursory inspection of the gear shortly after the accident before police removed it from the scene. One side (the report did not state which) of the main canopy showed signs of a severe entanglement between the suspension lines, canopy material, main pilot chute and main bridle. The reserve pilot chute had activated, and the reserve bridle was wrapped around the main canopy lines. The reserve canopy was still packed in the freebag with approximately three feet of the reserve lines extracted. The reserve lines and freebag were also entangled with the main canopy suspension lines. The reserve ripcord handle was not attached to the harness and was never found even after a thorough search of the area. Investigators believe that the jumper pulled the reserve handle soon after the main deployment. The coach reported that he observed the reserve pilot chute launch not long after the main canopy inflated and began to spin. The automatic activation device had also fired and cut the reserve closing loop. On this rig, the cutter was located at the bottom of the reserve tray and cut the loop even though the jumper manually deployed the reserve. Data from the automatic activation device indicated that the descent rate remained close to 65 feet per second for much of the time after the main canopy deployed, which was fast enough for the AAD to activate the cutter. The cutaway handle was detached from the harness, but the cutaway cables had extracted only approximately three to four inches. The left main riser detached from the harness, but it was found on the ground less than a foot from the harness. The right-side main riser, which included the attachment for the reserve static line, was still attached to the harness. Because of the close proximity of the left riser to the harness, investigators believe that the jumper did not pull the handle but that it dislodged upon impact. If the riser had released while the canopy was still descending in a spin, it would have entangled with the suspension lines and half of the canopy would have deflated and distorted. None of the witnesses reported seeing a distorted main canopy, and the detached left riser was not entangled with anything. Both steering toggles of the main canopy were stowed and the brakes were set. Based on the equipment inspection, investigators determined that the jumper pulled the reserve ripcord but that he had not first released the main canopy by pulling the cutaway handle. He correctly performed emergency procedures on the ground during his training. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 includes recommendations for emergency procedures, and it recommends that a jumper who experiences a partial malfunction release the main parachute by pulling the cutaway handle before deploying the reserve. This jumper also exhibited some difficulty reaching his deployment handle during several of his skydives. It is not uncommon for someone who is over 40 years old and new to skydiving (especially men) to have difficulty reaching the main deployment handle, mostly due to a lack of overall flexibility. While arching harder makes it easier to reach the handle and improves stability in freefall, students frequently make the mistake of bending forward at the waist in an effort to reach the handle. This actually makes the handle harder to reach and creates instability.;0.62546564129688;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;Yes;done

Investigators used the outside video footage to help determine the sequence of events in this fatality. The exit resulted in the pair performing a slightly head-down barrel roll. The instructor then threw the drogue as the pair settled into a belly-to-earth orientation. The drogue bridle entangled with the drogue handle, which prevented the drogue from inflating. The pair continued in freefall in a belly-to-earth orientation with the deflated drogue above them. On the video, the tandem instructor appeared to look up toward the drogue, and then as the tandem pair accelerated and dropped away from the videographer, the instructor checked the cutaway handle and reserve ripcord handle. After approximately 15 seconds, the videographer caught up to the tandem pair, and the tandem instructor moved both hands toward the drogue-release handles located at the lower left and right sides of the container, but he did not appear to actually touch either handle. Probably due to their high speed under the collapsed drogue, the tandem pair buffeted and rotated slowly as the tandem instructor attempted to control the heading during the droguefall. The tandem instructor pulled the cutaway handle and then the reserve ripcord handle approximately 45 seconds after exit. The reserve pilot cute launched out of the container and made one full rotation around the drogue bridle as it pulled the freebag—which began to travel up toward the collapsed drogue—out of the container. As the freebag reached the drogue, the reserve bridle and drogue remained locked together, which stopped the freebag from moving upward any farther. This essentially trapped the reserve canopy inside of the freebag for the remainder of the skydive. The tandem pair struck the ground without an inflated parachute, and the hard impact killed both the instructor and student instantly.;The tandem instructor exited the airplane presenting his right side to the relative wind, which caused the pair to roll to the right one time before he was able to throw the drogue. The drogue bridle entangled around the drogue handle, resulting in an uninflated drogue. Although the tandem pair was out of the video frame when the instructor deployed the drogue, it is likely that a packing error and not the unstable exit caused the entanglement. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, the appropriate response to a deflated drogue on a United Parachute Technologies Sigma tandem system is to immediately pull the drogue-release handle to initiate main canopy deployment (and expect a longer-than-normal deployment because of the deflated drogue). However, the tandem instructor continued in droguefall without pulling either of the drogue-release handles. He first performed an out-of-sequence handle check, touching only the cutaway handle followed by the reserve-ripcord handle, then visually checking the drogue and moving both hands toward the drogue-release handles, which are located on the left and right sides of the harness and container. However, he never actually touched or attempted to pull either handle. Every tandem instructor must do a handles check on every skydive and perform it in the correct sequence. For the United Parachute Technologies Sigma, the handle sequence following the drogue throw is to touch the primary drogue release, secondary drogue release, cutaway handle, reserve-ripcord handle and reserve static line, in that order, for every tandem skydive. Throughout the droguefall, the tandem instructor attempted to control the heading as the pair rotated slightly to the left and right while also pitching up and down between head-high and head-low positions. The lack of control was not drastic but may have distracted the instructor. The student was wearing loose-fitting clothing and the instructor wore shorts and a T-shirt, which, combined with the higher freefall speeds due to the deflated drogue, created the buffeting and heading-control problems. The tandem instructor would have had more control had he been dressed in a baggy jumpsuit. The Instructional Rating Manual recommends that tandem instructors wear baggy jumpsuits and students wear tighter-fitting jumpsuits to provide the instructor with more control over the student during droguefall. The proper response to the malfunctioned drogue was to immediately pull the primary drogue-release handle, which likely would have allowed the main canopy to deploy (although it may have taken more time and altitude than usual). However, the tandem instructor may have been confused about procedures for dealing with an uninflated drogue, since he appeared to look at it several times during the droguefall and never pulled a drogue-release handle. He eventually pulled only the cutaway handle and reserve ripcord, which leads investigators to believe that he reverted to emergency procedure training for solo equipment, because he missed the two critical steps in the tandem emergency procedures. The procedures outlined in the Sigma Tandem Manual call for the instructor to deploy the drogue, then if the drogue does not inflate immediately, the instructor should pull the primary drogue-release handle followed by the secondary drogue-release handle. If the main does not deploy, the instructor should release the reserve static line and pull the cutaway handle, ensuring that both risers have released from the harness before deploying the reserve parachute by pulling the reserve ripcord. The tandem instructor did not hold a tandem instructor rating from either United Parachute Technologies or the U.S. Parachute Association. A tandem instructor examiner who had been suspended by both UPT and USPA conducted his training. The instructor had reportedly completed his tandem training just a few weeks before this fatality occurred. Investigators reported that the instructor examiner may not have trained the instructor properly on emergency procedures. Tandem systems are much more complex than solo parachute equipment. Tandem candidates must receive proper training for all aspects of tandem skydiving, especially emergency procedures.;0.0274755399852185;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;3.0;Yes;done

Another jumper was outside of the formation filming, and investigators later reviewed the video to help with their investigation. This jumper exited the airplane and docked on the base of the formation in a normal manner. When the 12 jumpers completed the first point, they broke grips to build the second point, and this jumper began to backslide away. He then flipped onto his back and began to spin, dropping away from the other skydivers for the remainder of the freefall. A very experienced skydiver on the ground reported watching the formation separate and observing the jumpers’ main canopy deployments. He also observed this jumper spinning on his back in freefall until the reserve parachute deployed at approximately 1,000 feet. The jumper appeared to be hanging limp in the harness, and he did not move at all for the entire descent under the reserve canopy. The canopy flew downwind and landed in a field approximately 200 yards from the drop zone. Investigators reported that the main deployment handle, cutaway handle and reserve ripcord handle were in place and had not been pulled. The cutter of the automatic activation device had fired and cut the reserve closing loop, which initiated the reserve canopy deployment. Even though the reserve had fully inflated and was flying in a straight line with the brakes still stowed, when the jumper struck the ground without flaring the canopy, the landing caused him to flip forward over his head and neck, which resulted in injuries to his neck. First responders reached the jumper approximately 10 minutes after the landing. He was not breathing and did not have a pulse. The responders administered first aid until ambulance personnel arrived, but they were unable to revive the jumper and declared him dead at the scene.;This jumper experienced a heart attack after exiting the airplane. He had not experienced any medical problems in the past, although he reportedly had recently been diagnosed with a heart murmur and was taking medication for that condition. However, he decided to continue skydiving after the diagnosis. Skydiving places stress on the body, which is a good reason for jumpers to stay on top of medical issues and consult with a doctor if there are any concerns. Most medical experts recommend that men and women over age 40 receive regular medical checkups at least once a year. For those who have a family history of heart-related issues, a more thorough checkup is advisable. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 2-1.C states that all those engaging in skydiving must possess at least a current Federal Aviation Administration Third-Class Medical Certificate, carry a certificate of physical fitness for skydiving from a registered physician or agree with the USPA recommended medical statement in Section 4-3, which reads: “I represent and warrant that I have no known physical or mental infirmities that would impair my ability to participate in skydiving, or, if I do have such infirmities, that they have been or are being successfully treated so that they do not represent any foreseeable risk while skydiving. I also represent and warrant that I am not taking any medications or substances, prescription or otherwise, that would impair my ability to participate in skydiving.” Although the AAD activated the reserve and it fully deployed, the jumper experienced a hard landing after flying downwind and landing at the edge of a ditch without the ability to flare the parachute. The rough landing resulted in neck trauma that was likely fatal even if the heart attack was not.;7.532318777361787;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;12.0;No;done

Witnesses in the air reported that the main canopy deployed very quickly and opened hard. The witnesses then observed the main canopy in a spin in an unreported direction. The canopy continued to rotate as it descended, and witnesses in the air reported that the jumper appeared unconscious or dazed by the hard opening and did not take any action. At an altitude that witnesses on the ground estimated to be between 300 and 500 feet, the jumper pulled the cutaway handle and released the main canopy. The reserve static line immediately pulled the reserve ripcord, and the reserve canopy fully inflated, but the jumper was above a forested area. Ground witnesses estimated that the jumper was no higher than 100 feet above the trees when his reserve fully inflated. Witnesses observed him reaching to release the brakes of his reserve as he struck the top of a tall tree. The reserve collapsed after the collision with the tree, and the top of the tree snapped, which caused the jumper to drop the remaining 80 feet to the ground under his uninflated reserve. The jumper received immediate medical attention but died shortly after reaching the hospital from the injuries he sustained in the hard landing.;"Investigators recovered the main canopy and found the right brake released and the left brake still stowed. It is not uncommon for one brake to release during a hard opening. Investigators did not report any other problems with the jumper’s gear. The jumper had not packed the canopy himself; a packer who was under the supervision of a Federal Aviation Administration rigger reportedly did. Previous accident reports have attributed neck injuries, internal injuries and even paralysis to hard openings. In this case, investigators could not determine whether the jumper was initially unconscious or awake but unable to respond after the hard opening. In either case, the jumper did not take immediate action and cut away at a higher altitude. Had he been able to cut away higher or if he had been over an open area under his reserve canopy, he may have been able to land uneventfully. Unfortunately, the combination of a low reserve deployment with being over a heavily forested area left him without any options. There was no indication that the jumper’s age was a factor in this accident. However, even though he was in good health, a hard opening is likely to be much more traumatic to a jumper who is 70 than a jumper who is 25. As we age, we need to keep in mind that the sport of skydiving presents additional physical challenges. Hard openings have been a part of skydiving since the beginning of the sport, and a jumper can experience a hard opening under any parachute. Careful packing according to the manufacturer’s instructions can help to reduce the chance of experiencing a hard opening. Freefall speed, body position and the condition of the parachute equipment can also affect the opening force of a canopy.";27.85396270585952;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;1.0;Yes;done

Nobody observed the canopy descent just prior to seeing the canopy spinning. The canopy appeared to fully re-inflate immediately before impact, but it was pointed directly at the ground. The jumper struck the ground at nearly the same time as the nose of the canopy. He received immediate first aid, but the hard impact with the ground killed him instantly.;Investigators reported that no one witnessed this jumper’s canopy flight before he was in a spin under the partially collapsed main canopy. However, they suspect that the cause of the spin was an overly aggressive input to the main canopy such as a very hard and quick pull on a front riser. Investigators checked the main canopy suspension lines and found them to be in trim, but the condition of the main canopy itself was reportedly very poor, and the top skin had three tears ranging from nine to 22 inches long. Investigators believe that these tears occurred when the nose of the canopy forcefully struck the ground. It is common to find canopy damage like this after such an impact because the air pressure rapidly increases as it is forced into the canopy with no place to escape when the nose hits the ground. All three tears were located where the fabric was folded. The creases were set and showed discoloration, which led investigators to believe that the canopy had been folded and stored for a long period and in such a way that it was exposed to sunlight or other elements that weakened the fabric. The canopy also had four patches, and the fabric failed pull-testing. (It tore when investigators pulled it by hand.) The report stated that the jumper recently purchased this canopy, but investigators did not know whether a parachute rigger or the manufacturer had inspected it. Before jumping any recently purchased new or used equipment, jumpers should always have a parachute rigger or manufacturer inspect it to help ensure that it is airworthy. This jumper made 500 jumps over a 12-year period and was jumping a cross-braced canopy at a wing loading of 2.1:1. The report did not state the jumper’s previous canopy history, but he must have downsized rapidly to be jumping such a small, cross-braced canopy with just 500 jumps. Jumpers who wish to fly small canopies at moderate or high wing loadings should seek professional canopy coaching and use a structured training program for the downsizing progression to help reduce as much of the risk as possible.;6.266974810140942;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;;No;done

One jumper filmed the other six. Investigators reported that all four jumpers passed through the hoop before reaching breakoff altitude but did not report what altitude this was. The two jumpers holding the hoop were approximately 100 yards from the four jumpers who had passed through the hoop. Just after breakoff, as the two groups began to separate, one of the jumpers who was holding the hoop and this jumper tracked in a converging direction and collided. This jumper struck the leg of the jumper holding the hoop. The jumper holding the hoop deployed her main canopy. She was bruised but otherwise uninjured from the collision and landed uneventfully under her main canopy. This jumper was apparently injured during the collision, as investigators reported that he tumbled for a few seconds afterward. He was able to deploy his main canopy, although investigators did not know at what altitude. A witness in the air reported that the jumper was not completely stable during his main deployment, and the main canopy appeared to open very hard. The main canopy had several line twists and began to spin as it descended. The reason this jumper did not perform emergency procedures is unknown, but he may have lost consciousness. He landed hard under his spinning main canopy. Later, investigators on the ground found that the canopy still had major line twists and that the brakes on both main risers were still stowed. The other jumpers on the skydive located this jumper in a field soon after he landed. The jumper was still alive but had suffered head trauma and internal injuries. Emergency personnel airlifted him to a local hospital where he died of his injuries approximately one month later.;Investigators did not report whether the group had a plan for breakoff for this skydive, but it is likely that the jumpers did discuss a breakoff altitude at the very least. With the four hoop divers separated from the two jumpers holding the hoop at breakoff time, two separate groups each had their own formation center as the jumpers began to track away. This put a jumper from each group on converging paths. Planning a group skydive of any type should always include a predetermined altitude for breakoff and a plan for each jumper to track away for horizontal separation. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 6-1 recommends that jumpers turn 180 degrees from the center of the formation and flat track to gain separation before deployment. This works well as long as the jump goes as planned and all of the jumpers in the group are docked on or near the formation. When jumps don’t go as planned—if the jumpers are low or high on breakoff, the jumpers have a large amount of horizontal separation or the formations are not very symmetrical—it can lead to confusion. Jumpers may not track in the correct direction or may be at different levels and speeds as the group tries to separate. This can lead to collisions in freefall. Jumpers taking part in hoop dives, raft dives and other unusual freefall formations need to formulate a contingency plan for incomplete formations and other issues with the skydive. Often this will require a last-second change in tracking direction or breakoff altitude to compensate for the unexpected situation. After the collision, this jumper was able to deploy his main canopy, but a head-low unstable body position may have led to a hard opening of his main canopy. Once the main canopy was open and spinning, the jumper was unable to respond or initiate emergency procedures.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;7.0;No;done

The hanging jumper, who was not wearing a wingsuit, intended to hang underneath the second wingsuiter during the entire formation flight, then let go of the chest strap to fall free before deploying her own main canopy. Approximately 15 seconds after exiting, the hanging jumper dropped off the chest strap of the second wingsuiter and began to fall away. Investigators reported that the two wingsuiters then continued in flight, apparently focused on staying with the jumper who had dropped off of the chest strap. About 33 seconds after exiting, the first wingsuiter struck the second wingsuiter from above and behind. The first wingsuiter’s head and neck struck the back of the second wingsuiter’s right leg. The impact occurred with significant speed and energy, breaking the tibia and fibula of the second wingsuiter. The second wingsuiter deployed his main canopy shortly after the collision. While under canopy he used his cell phone to call the drop zone and ask for assistance. He received immediate medical attention after landing in the main landing area. The first wingsuiter continued in freefall after the impact—which caused either death or unconsciousness—without deploying a main or reserve parachute. He descended into a large group of trees where he was located the next day following an extensive search.;Wingsuit flying generates significant forward speed, which requires proper control by all participants. Investigators did not know the wingsuit experience level of either jumper, and could only estimate that the second wingsuiter had approximately 200 wingsuit jumps. The addition of the hanging jumper added complexity to the 2-way wingsuit flight, and the jumpers should have prepared alternatives if the jump did not go as planned. It would have been safer if the jumpers had planned, in the event that the hanger fell off early, for the wingsuit pair to fly a pre-determined flight path while the other jumper continued in a solo freefall. Instead, the wingsuit flyers reportedly focused on flying to the third jumper. Investigators could not determine whether the first wingsuiter lost sight of the second wingsuiter. However, his forward speed and descent rate were much greater than the second wingsuiter’s, and he was either killed or knocked unconscious after striking the second wingsuiter in the leg. Since he could not shield his face with his arms (because wingsuits restrict arm movement), his head took the brunt of the impact. The coroner reported significant trauma to the deceased jumper’s head and face, in addition to blunt-force trauma to a significant portion of his body. The jumper wore a helmet of an unreported type. Skydiving helmets offer protection in the event of light collisions, but work less effectively for collisions with significant energy such as this one. He was not equipped with an automatic activation device, which may have activated his reserve and given him a last chance to survive the jump if the freefall collision had not already killed him. Like any other skydiving discipline, flying a wingsuit requires proper planning and execution of the jump by all of the participants in order to eliminate as much of the risk as possible. There is no room for error or complacency in any type of skydiving. However, wingsuiting adds additional speed and complexity that jumpers must plan for and respect.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;3.0;No;done

Ground witnesses reported that he initiated an aggressive left-hand front-riser turn at approximately 100 feet above the ground in order to face into the wind for his final approach. He reportedly focused on the landing area and did not see that another jumper under canopy at nearly the same altitude was already on final approach and had passed in front of him just a few seconds before he made his turn. As the first jumper came out of his turn, he was directly behind the second jumper, and his canopy partially collapsed as it passed through the wake of the second jumper’s canopy. There may have been light contact between the two jumpers’ canopies or lines or both. The second jumper, who was in front, was able to land normally but reported feeling a bump while on final approach. The first jumper struck the ground hard under a partially collapsed canopy. He received immediate medical attention, but the hard impact killed him instantly.;"Although this jumper was flying a standard landing pattern, his turn to final approach at 100 feet was much lower than typical. A typical pattern would start at 1,000 feet and the final-approach turn would begin at approximately 300 feet. When this jumper made his turn, a second jumper had already turned at a higher altitude onto final approach and was flying into the wind. The first jumper then hit wake turbulence—the rolling vortices of air that extended behind a wing in flight—produced by the second jumper. Wake turbulence generated by other canopies (or aircraft) can be a hazard as significant as the mechanical turbulence created by winds blowing across obstacles such as tall trees or buildings. Because a jumper under canopy is descending, turbulent air is angled above and behind the jumper. Someone flying directly behind will encounter wake turbulence just a few feet behind and above the canopy; if flying farther back, the jumper will encounter wake turbulence higher. According to the canopy manufacturer Performance Designs, “Wake turbulence extends back along the flight path of a canopy. Significant effects may be felt more than 50 feet (15 meters) away from the canopy that generated the wake. Wake turbulence normally descends and dissipates quickly, but it is still possible to encounter it along a canopy’s flight path several seconds after the canopy has passed. It is important to avoid flying close behind another canopy at lower altitudes, particularly during the final approach and landing.” Historically, most canopy collisions that occur below 1,000 feet at pattern altitudes happen near the intersection of the base leg and the final-approach leg. That is what happened here, although the jumper’s turn to final approach was lower than normal. This jumper reportedly made an aggressive turn toward his final approach and was most likely completely focused on the landing area to his left while preparing to make the turn to increase his forward speed. He apparently did not see the nearby jumper under canopy until he had made his turn and the canopy was directly in front of him. Investigators did not report whether the second jumper noticed the first jumper’s position and converging flight path. Jumpers must plan landing descents that allow them to enter their landing patterns with as few nearby canopies as possible. By adjusting the descent rate at higher altitudes (lowering it by holding in brakes or increasing it with front-riser input), it is possible to gain vertical separation from other canopy traffic. Once at pattern altitudes, it is critical that every jumper continue scanning for canopy traffic. It takes two jumpers to have a collision under canopy but just one to avoid it. Even if one jumper fails to notice the converging path, if the other jumper is watching carefully and sees the impending collision, he can take action ahead of time. However, all jumpers must avoid the common mistake of focusing only on the landing area and ignoring the surrounding airspace while flying at pattern altitudes.";6.559992257969978;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;2.0;No;done

The main canopy opened fully, and the jumper descended over the main landing area and prepared for a high-performance landing. He initiated a 360-degree left-hand front-riser turn starting at approximately 900 feet. Toward the end of the turn but before the canopy leveled off for landing, the left main riser disconnected from the harness at about 300 to 400 feet above the ground, which caused the main canopy to partially collapse and spin. The jumper immediately pulled his cutaway handle to release the main canopy, but at this point he was just 200 feet above the ground and was unable to pull the reserve ripcord before impact. He received immediate medical attention, but the hard impact had killed him instantly.;Investigators who checked the gear on the ground found that the left riser had detached from the harness and container, which caused the partial deflation of the canopy described by witnesses. Investigators inspected the parachute equipment carefully, and also sent the equipment to the manufacturer for further inspection. Nobody found any damage or defects that would have caused the main riser to release. However, investigators reported that just prior to the jump, the jumper—who was in the middle of a busy hangar and talking to a student—had swapped out his main canopy for another canopy that was already assembled on risers. Investigators determined that when he hooked up the left main riser in the middle of a busy and distracting environment, he neglected to route the type 2A nylon locking loop through the grommet at the end of the cutaway-cable housing. The riser remained in place and attached to the harness throughout the freefall, deployment and initial canopy descent since the cutaway cable was routed through the locking loop. But because the locking loop did not pass through the grommet at the end of the cutaway-cable housing, nothing secured the cutaway cable and prevented it from slipping out. Once the jumper pulled down hard on the left front riser to initiate an aggressive turn to final approach, it removed enough tension from the cutaway cable to allow it to slip free from the locking loop, releasing the riser from the harness ring. Once the riser disconnected, the jumper immediately pulled his cutaway handle to release the main canopy. However, he did not have time to pull his reserve handle because he was just 200 feet above the ground. Another option would have been to just deploy the reserve without cutting away, which might have allowed the reserve to deploy, inflate and slow his descent rate. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 states, “At some point in the descent under a partial malfunction, it becomes too low for a safe cutaway and you must deploy the reserve without cutting away.” However, at such a low altitude, this would have required an instantaneous response, and there still would have been little chance of the reserve inflating before the jumper struck the ground. In addition, if the jumper had used a reserve static line or main-assisted-reserve-deployment device, it is possible that the device would have deployed the reserve in time, particularly if the jumper was actually higher than the 200 feet estimated for his cutaway. An instant activation of the reserve parachute would have provided a greater chance of surviving a low-altitude cutaway than manually activating the reserve by pulling the reserve-ripcord handle following the cutaway. A thorough gear check could have prevented this fatality. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-4 includes information on pre-jump safety checks. Each jumper should perform a careful gear check three times: before putting on the gear, after gearing up but prior to boarding the airplane and again before exiting the aircraft. This is commonly referred to as the “check of threes” and includes checking the three straps (chest strap and two leg straps), three handles (cutaway, reserve-ripcord and main-deployment handles), three-ring system (to ensure correct assembly) and closing pins (to ensure that they are fully seated and under proper tension and that the main-pilot-chute bridle is cocked). Performing thorough gear checks as part of every skydive can help ensure that the parachute system is ready for use.;19.64929954341942;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;Yes;1.0;No;done

His helmet-mounted GoPro camera was on and recorded his descent, and investigators were later able to view the footage to determine exactly what caused this incident. As the jumper descended through approximately 400 feet with the main landing area to his right, he initiated a right front-riser turn by grabbing the riser’s dive loop and pulling toward the center of his chest. As he pulled on the riser, his head leaned slightly to the right. After turning 90 degrees with the front riser, he let up on the riser to stop the turn at approximately 200 feet above the ground, but the right steering line caught on the GoPro camera, possibly wedging itself between the camera and the mount on the front of his helmet, which caused the canopy to remain in a right turn. The jumper tried to free the steering line as the canopy continued in its fast rotation. He was unable to clear the entanglement in the few seconds he had, and he struck the ground hard in a diving turn. He received immediate medical attention, but the impact with the ground killed him instantly.;This accident points out the dangers of small-format cameras for the casual camera user. Many jumpers consider small-format cameras to be an easy and trouble-free method of recording a skydive. However, the risks of an entanglement such as this one remain a significant factor that every jumper who elects to start using a camera of any size must consider. This jumper’s unusual method of using his front riser contributed to the entanglement. Instead of pulling the front riser straight down, keeping it in line with the right rear riser, he pulled it to the left toward his chest, which brought the steering line directly across the front of his helmet, trapping the line on the camera. Once the line became entangled, the jumper had three options available to possibly solve the problem, but each would have required an instant reaction to be effective. He could have pulled the helmet cutaway handle (the helmet was equipped with a quick-release system), which may have allowed him to steer the canopy even if the helmet remained attached to the line. If the type of mounting hardware allowed it, he could have grabbed the camera and pulled it free of his helmet, which may have allowed the steering line to clear the entanglement. Finally, he could have pulled down on the left steering toggle until it was equal to the length of the trapped right-side steering line, which would have countered the turn and returned the canopy to straight and level flight. Although he may have had a hard, no-flare landing, landing in partial brakes with a level wing would have been better than landing in a diving turn at a much higher vertical descent rate. Unfortunately, this entanglement occurred at the worst possible time: just before landing. With just two or three seconds remaining, the jumper had almost no time to regain control of the canopy before he struck the ground. Any additional equipment adds complexity to a skydive. Jumpers must carefully consider the risks associated with each jump, as well as the additional challenges of adding a camera system. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 6-8 includes recommendations for the use of cameras while skydiving.;6.5842968601013325;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

The tandem pair exited from a Cessna Caravan at 13,000 feet and flew in a stable, belly-to-earth body position. For unknown reasons, the tandem instructor did not deploy the drogue parachute, and the pair continued in drogueless freefall. At approximately 5,000 feet, the tandem instructor attempted to release the drogue parachute by pulling on the first and then the second drogue-release handles. However, by design, the main container remained closed because the drogue was not deployed. The instructor then pulled the reserve ripcord handle and deployed the reserve canopy. The incident report did not state the reserve-activation altitude. However, the report stated that the automatic activation device activated its reserve-loop cutter but the loop remained intact, which indicates that the instructor deployed the reserve at around the AAD activation altitude of 1,900 feet, before it cut the loop but after it had already begun the process of firing. The reserve parachute deployed normally, and the instructor released the brakes and descended toward the main landing area. Witnesses on the ground reported that the tandem pair was descending normally under a stable parachute when the canopy appeared to encounter turbulence at approximately 200 feet above the ground. Witnesses on the ground observed the canopy bucking and surging, then spinning to the left. The pair struck the ground hard in a diving turn. Both the student and the instructor received immediate first aid. However, the student suffered multiple broken bones and internal injuries from the hard landing, which killed her instantly. She was not wearing a helmet (which USPA recommends for all students, including tandems), but given the extent of her injuries, it would not likely have changed the outcome. The instructor was airlifted to a hospital with multiple broken bones, including several broken ribs and a broken leg, and is expected to make a full recovery. He has an incomplete memory of the events leading up to the accident.;The reasons for the instructor failing to deploy the drogue after exiting the airplane are unknown, but he may have been focusing exclusively on the freefall training since the student was working toward earning her USPA A license. Once he realized the drogue was not deployed and he could therefore not deploy the main parachute, he pulled the reserve ripcord to deploy the reserve parachute, which was the correct emergency procedure in this situation. Investigators found that the drogue was properly packed and could be removed from its pouch with the normal amount of pull force. A Federal Aviation Administration Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner inspected the reserve parachute and found no defects or damage. Although the reserve parachute may have handled differently than the main, the failure to deploy the drogue and the subsequent reserve activation did not appear to have any direct effect on later events. Investigators reported that winds on the ground were 14-15 mph and that no unusual weather patterns (such as thunderstorms) were nearby. They did not report any nearby obstacles that could have created turbulence. Witnesses on the ground did not observe any dust devils, which in this desert environment would likely have been visible due to the swirling dirt and debris they pick up. The canopy appeared to have been affected by air turbulence such as a wind shear, which is invisible to anyone under canopy or on the ground until the canopy itself passes through the unstable air. In this case, there was not enough altitude for the canopy to regain stable flight before the pair struck the ground. Had they encountered the turbulence higher, the instructor may have had a chance to regain control of the canopy and land with a slower vertical speed.;0.0565052438790611;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;Yes;Yes;No;2.0;No;done

According to one of the jumpers who was on the skydive, the exit, freefall and breakoff were uneventful. Investigators reported that this jumper deployed his main canopy at an altitude of 2,000 feet or just slightly lower and apparently experienced some sort of malfunction (the type is unknown) of the main canopy. At some point soon after the main deployment, the jumper pulled his metal D-ring style cutaway handle to release the main canopy, but only the right riser released from the harness. The jumper pulled the metal handle with enough force to free the right riser, but the left side of the cutaway cable remained in place. (The orange Teflon-coated cutaway cable was a continuous cable that passed through two holes in the metal reserve handle to form the left and right side cutaway cables.) As he continued to pull harder on the handle, it stripped the Teflon coating off the right cable, and the handle came off. The left-side cable remained attached to the riser, trapped in severe line twists that pinched the end of the cutaway cable. Witnesses on the ground reported that the jumper’s main canopy was spinning as he descended out of view behind a tree line. He pulled the reserve ripcord at a very low altitude; ground witnesses reported it as being just above the treetops. Responders found him soon after he struck the ground. The main canopy was still attached to the left side of the harness, and the reserve canopy had cleared its freebag but had not had enough altitude for inflation. Investigators found the reserve ripcord handle about 20 feet from the jumper, and the main and reserve canopies were clear of each other and not entangled. They also found the cutaway handle with the stripped-off section of Teflon coating still attached to it. Medical personnel responded immediately, but the hard impact under the partially inflated main canopy had killed the jumper instantly.";Investigators sent the parachute equipment to a Federal Aviation Administration Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner for an inspection to determine exactly what occurred with the gear. The DPRE determined that the main canopy risers had twisted tightly together during the main canopy deployment. The risers, which were likely the 2012 container’s original pair, included a channel for storing the free ends of the cutaway cable, but this channel did not include a hard metal housing. Most modern riser designs incorporate a metal housing in this channel to prevent the free ends of the cutaway cable from being pinched and held in place. The manufacturer of these risers offers hard housings as an option, but these did not have them installed. Consequently, once the risers twisted together, they applied tension directly to the free ends of the cutaway cable, greatly increasing the amount of pull force required to release the risers. Additionally, the DPRE reported that because the two sides of the cutaway cable had not been swaged (bound together by pressure or crimping), the handle was free to slip off of the cable once enough force was applied to it. The DPRE reported that the cutaway cable pulled out of the housing with the normal amount of resistance during his inspection of the gear. This indicated that there was nothing in the metal cable housing that prevented the cable from moving freely and that the twisted riser had created enough tension while the jumper was under canopy to prevent the cable from releasing. During previous pull-force tests on its metal D-ring cutaway handle, the manufacturer found that it took at least 300 pounds of pull force for the handle to move in relation to the cable. The manufacturer has requested to inspect the actual equipment involved in this incident but has not yet received it from the authorities holding the gear. Although the jumper initiated a cutaway soon after his main deployment, he initiated deployment at a relatively low altitude (approximately 2,000 feet), which gave him very little time to discover and resolve the problem with releasing the main canopy. He also may have lost altitude awareness in the short time he had remaining. He eventually did pull his reserve ripcord, but he was at a very low altitude. Had he deployed the reserve at a higher altitude, it may have been able to fully inflate.;26.73378672095053;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;;No;done

The canopy immediately began to spin after deployment, so the jumper released the main canopy, and his SkyHook main-assisted-reserve-deployment system deployed his reserve canopy. He landed uneventfully under the reserve.;After retrieving the main canopy, investigators discovered that the right front riser had separated at the top where the suspension lines connect to it. The riser end had been glued together to form the loop at the top of the riser (a normal part of riser construction) but had not been sewn together. The force of the deployment caused the riser to separate and release the suspension lines of the canopy.

The jumper is expected to make a full recovery following surgery.;With just 225 jumps and two years in the sport, this jumper was very inexperienced to be jumping a fully elliptical parachute and attempting high-performance turns. A more appropriate response to recovery from a turn initiated too low would have been to flare with the toggles not the rear risers. The report did not provide the jumper’s previous canopy experience, but he must have downsized rapidly to be jumping an elliptical canopy at a 1.3:1 wing loading with his number of jumps.

The report did not state whether he required medical assistance.;Jumpers should always assess their situations while descending under canopy and have a plan for an alternate landing that allows for a safe descent into a clear, open area. This jumper made a good decision to avoid making a low turn in an attempt to face into the wind, which has caused fatalities in the past. However, when faced with an obstacle such as a hangar or airplane on the ground, it is often possible to make a slight change in heading to land in a clear space beside the obstacle, rather than fixate on the obstacle itself and fly into something that may be easily avoidable.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;;No;done

Investigators reported that if he had remained facing into the wind, he would likely have landed on the grass landing area and not continued past the grass onto the asphalt. At approximately 200 feet, he initiated a 360-degree turn in an unreported direction. He struck the ground while the canopy was still in a diving turn. The hard landing resulted in multiple broken bones and head trauma. He received immediate medical attention and transportation to a hospital but died several days after the accident when he was removed from life support.;Investigators reported that the landing area was unobstructed and there were no other jumpers under canopy nearby. Near the main landing area were several other grass areas separated by asphalt taxiways or airplane parking areas, all of which were unobstructed and clear of any hazards such as parked airplanes. Investigators could not conclusively determine why this jumper initiated a last-second turn. The jumper may have thought that he would land on the asphalt if he continued flying forward and that he had enough altitude to complete a 360-degree turn before reaching the ground. Jumpers should plan and execute landing patterns that allow them to land in clear and unobstructed areas. In this case, even if the jumper did land on the asphalt, doing so under a level canopy facing into the wind would have been a safer alternative than a hard landing on grass in a diving turn. With no other canopy traffic in the immediate area, another option would have been to turn just enough to remain over the grass and land crosswind using a parachute landing fall. Investigators reported that the wind speeds on the ground were 15-18 mph at the time. The jumper may have been intimidated about landing crosswind or downwind with winds at this speed. However, stopping the turn and flaring the canopy while traveling crosswind or downwind may have been a safer alternative to continuing the turn in an attempt to land facing into the wind. A jumper must complete all turns with enough altitude remaining to land with the wing level for the landing flare.;3.637753854670285;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;Yes;;No;done

His main canopy began to spin in an unreported direction immediately after deployment. Later investigations could not determine the cause of the spin. At approximately 1,500 feet, the jumper deployed his reserve parachute but did not pull the cutaway handle to release the main canopy first. The reserve freebag cleared the reserve canopy, but the freebag bridle and deploying reserve, which only partially inflated, entangled with the main canopy. Investigators who later inspected the equipment determined that at some point after the two canopies entangled, the jumper pulled the cutaway handle, but the main canopy remained entangled with the reserve. The jumper continued spinning under the two entangled and partially inflated canopies for the remainder of the descent and struck the ground hard. Responders arrived immediately to provide medical attention, but the impact had killed him instantly.;"Investigators reported that this jumper had been jumping for more than 30 years and was current. He participated in Safety Day seven months before the accident and practiced his emergency procedures at that time. Investigators did not know whether he had practiced them since. Several very experienced parachute riggers, including a Federal Aviation Administration Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner, assisted with the inspection of the equipment. Investigators did not find the reserve ripcord, but the main canopy cutaway handle was still with the container, and several inches of the longer, left-side cutaway cable remained inside the cable housing. Both main risers were released from the container. The right main riser was clear of the reserve lines, but the left main riser was entangled with the reserve bridle and the reserve suspension lines. The reserve was partially inflated, and the main canopy was entangled with the reserve lines and canopy. Both main canopy brakes were released, but the brakes on the reserve were still stowed. Investigators concluded that the jumper pulled the reserve handle before releasing the main canopy but were unable to determine why. He may have intended to pull both handles rapidly, and his right hand may have slipped off of the cutaway pillow while his left hand pulled the reserve ripcord; however, this is only speculation. Jumpers often simulate pulling their handles rapidly, using a quick one-two punch, when practicing their emergency procedures. However, during a partial malfunction, jumpers must pull each handle deliberately and should pull the reserve ripcord only after ensuring the main canopy has detached from the harness. It is important to practice emergency procedures in a realistic manner using appropriate training aids. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that jumpers simulate a malfunction on the ground and pull their cutaway and reserve handles at every reserve repack.";16.90234240153763;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;Yes;done

Several skydivers on the ground reported hearing a loud noise, consistent with a severely hard opening, as the canopy inflated. The jumper’s main canopy began to spin immediately after deployment and continued to spin for the remainder of the descent. Witnesses who were under canopy reported seeing the jumper spinning under his canopy and apparently unconscious during the entire descent. However, one nearby witness on the ground reported that the jumper was yelling just before impact. Investigators reported that they found the main canopy torn in several places and one brake released with its guide ring torn off of the back of the riser. Investigators did not report the direction of the spin or which riser sustained the damage and did not go into specifics about the canopy damage. Investigators found the reserve canopy outside of the container next to the jumper, but it was still in its freebag with the majority of the reserve lines stowed in the pouch. The jumper received immediate medical attention, but responders declared him dead at the scene due to multiple injuries including head trauma, internal injuries and several broken bones.;Although impact with the ground can cause equipment damage, the main canopy and riser damage was consistent with the hard opening and spinning main canopy that the witnesses reported. However, investigators determined that the reserve container opened from the force of impact with the ground. The jumper did not react to the malfunction and initiate emergency procedures after the hard opening, but investigators were not able to determine whether the opening knocked him unconscious or left him conscious but physically incapacitated. Although he was unresponsive for most of his descent, a witness heard him yell before he reached the ground, which could indicate that he regained consciousness just before the impact. It’s also possible that he suffered a broken neck from the hard opening, which would have left him conscious but unable to move or initiate emergency procedures. While most hard parachute openings result in uneventful deployments with minor or no injuries to the jumper, they have occasionally resulted in injuries or fatalities. Careful packing according to the manufacturer’s instructions can help to reduce the chances of experiencing a hard opening.

One witness who was on the ground about a quarter mile away from the freefalling jumper did not remember seeing a main pilot chute. Another witness who was under canopy reported seeing the jumper in freefall with his main pilot chute deployed. Responders found the jumper with his main pilot chute out of its pocket on the bottom of the container. The main container was open, and the closing loop had broken. This indicates that the main pin was in place until the impact with the ground broke the main closing loop. The jumper had pulled his cutaway handle, which investigators found approximately 150 feet from the body. Based on the location of the handle and the light winds at the time of the jump, investigators believe that the jumper pulled his cutaway handle approximately 1,000 feet above the ground. The reserve parachute did not deploy, and responders found the reserve ripcord handle still in place on the main lift web of the parachute container. The container was not equipped with an automatic activation device. The hard impact killed the jumper instantly.;A Federal Aviation Administration Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner inspected the jumper’s equipment and reported that the main pilot chute and bridle were very worn and nearly un-airworthy. This likely contributed to the pilot chute failing to pull the main closing pin and open the main container. Investigators did not report any marks or friction burns that would point to an entanglement of the bridle, and ground witnesses reported seeing the jumper in a stable body position all the way to impact. Investigators also reported that this jumper had been known to deploy “a little low” during larger formation skydives rather than risk flying in heavier canopy traffic after deploying at higher altitudes with the other jumpers on the load. However, the actual altitude that he first tried to initiate deployment on this skydive is not known. This jumper was a very current skydiver who made more than 6,000 jumps over a 17-year period and more than 150 in the previous year. However, he may not have been current as far as practicing emergency procedures or experiencing actual malfunctions. He may have been caught off guard when the main canopy did not deploy and lost track of altitude while attempting to resolve the problem. Pulling the cutaway handle during a pilot-chute-in-tow malfunction simply releases the main risers from the container and does nothing else. The jumper must pull the reserve ripcord to activate the reserve parachute. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 lists two responses for a pilot-chute-in-tow malfunction: Cut away, then immediately deploy the reserve parachute. Deploy the reserve parachute immediately. Both methods have pros and cons, and some equipment may require a specific action. Jumpers must thoroughly understand their equipment and practice emergency procedures frequently to help ensure that they’ll respond correctly during a malfunction. Additionally, an automatic activation device can serve as a valuable backup in the event that a jumper does not open a main or reserve parachute.;17.838215364315932;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;16.0;No;done

He climbed out of the airplane and stood on the step in a poised position while holding onto the strut then checked with the instructor for the command to exit. When he let go of the strut while poised on the step, he rotated backward. He then backflipped as the static line deployed his main canopy. One of his legs entangled with the main canopy’s suspension lines, which pulled on one or more lines on one side of the canopy and caused it to spin. Shortly afterward, he pulled his cutaway handle to release the main canopy. As the main canopy released, the reserve static line pulled the reserve ripcord and deployed the reserve. However, the partially inflated main canopy remained entangled with the jumper’s leg. The fully inflated reserve and partially inflated main then began rotating around each other in a slow circle. The jumper descended under the two canopies while rotating at a moderate speed and eventually went behind a row of trees out of view of witnesses on the ground. First responders reached him shortly after he landed on the flat ground behind the tree line, but he was unresponsive, and emergency personnel declared him dead at the scene.;Investigators reported that this jumper stated that he had previous military jump experience on both static-line and freefall jumps. He had no problem climbing out of the airplane and positioning on the step for his exit. However, when he let go of the airplane, he rotated backward off of the step. The Instructional Rating Manual states that there is a risk of the student backflipping while exiting if he releases the strut before moving off the step. A hanging exit can help prevent a backflip, but the student must be strong enough to hold onto the strut while hanging. This jumper weighed more than 200 pounds, which may have made it difficult for him to hang for the exit. Almost all static-line exits are uneventful even if the student does not perform the exit correctly. However, this exit resulted in the jumper’s leg entangling with the main canopy suspension lines. Investigators reported that first responders included several medical professionals who reached the jumper within a few minutes of his landing. When they found him, he had a bluish tint to his skin (which indicates lack of oxygen in the blood) and a laceration on his chin that was not bleeding. The ambulance personnel stated that the jumper may have suffered a heart attack, but the coroner found no evidence of this and reported that he died from head and neck injuries. Although no one witnessed the landing, it is likely that the landing was the cause of those injuries.;0.0274755399852185;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

Several witnesses, including some very experienced skydivers and pilots, stood beside the landing area watching canopies land. When the tandem pair was approximately 150-200 feet above the ground and preparing to turn to final approach, a solo jumper preparing to land below them passed through a dust devil. Although no one could see the dust devil because it had formed over an area of grass and asphalt and therefore hadn’t picked up debris, the witnesses on the ground saw the effects on the landing canopies and noticed nearby wind indicators suddenly start to move erratically in the strong winds. The solo jumper’s canopy partially collapsed just as he was about to touch down, and although he suffered a hard landing, he was uninjured. He was able to avoid the strong winds from dragging him by collapsing and controlling the canopy until the dust devil passed by. At approximately 50-75 feet above the ground, the tandem pair passed through the same dust devil. The left side of the canopy collapsed, and the canopy rapidly turned approximately 180 degrees to the right. The tandem pair struck the ground in a hard, diving turn, and the partially inflated main canopy dragged them across the ground for more than 300 feet before the dust devil finally threw them clear. They came to rest on a concrete taxiway with the instructor on his back and the student on top of him. The pair received immediate medical attention. The first responders unhooked the student harness from the instructor’s harness to separate the pair and then administered first aid to both. The student was unconscious and had multiple injuries to his head and torso. The instructor was conscious and reported difficulty breathing. Ambulance personnel arrived and declared the student dead at the scene. Emergency personnel airlifted the instructor to a local hospital with serious injuries, including a broken neck that caused quadriplegia.;"Dust devils can form suddenly, and they can be nearly impossible to see over grass and asphalt areas such as this one, because they pick up little to no debris from the ground. (When they form in a desert environment, the dirt and dust picked up from the ground make them easier to spot and avoid.) Dust devils form as the sun heats two different surfaces and the warm air, heated at different rates, rises and begins to spiral. A dust devil’s swirling column of air can rise as high as 1,500 feet above the ground, although it is more common for them to top out at around 300 feet. They usually form during warm, calm-wind days. Investigators reported that this was just such a day; winds were five to 10 mph and the temperature approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If the tandem pair had passed through the dust devil at a higher altitude, the parachute may have been able to recover to level flight before landing. Unfortunately, since the pair encountered the dust devil at 50-75 feet above the ground, the canopy had no chance of recovering to level flight, and the instructor and student struck the ground in a diving turn. The student, who was not wearing a helmet, suffered head injuries. The Instructional Rating Manual recommends that instructors equip tandem students with soft or hard helmets (hard helmets only if the instructors wear full-face helmets). Most instructors who equip students with helmets provide them with soft, leather-type helmets, which are not designed for protection against hard impacts such as this one. A hard-shell helmet offers better protection against hard landings but may not have prevented this fatality.";;Yes;Yes;No;tandem;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;2.0;No;done

The freefall was uneventful, and both jumpers flew their planned flight path. They separated at 5,500 feet, and this jumper deployed his main canopy at approximately 3,500 feet. Video footage from the other wingsuit skydiver showed that this jumper’s main canopy opened in line twists and began turning slowly. The jumper descended under his slowly spinning main canopy until he reached approximately 1,000 feet, at which point witnesses on the ground and under canopy observed the spin and descent rate of the canopy rapidly increase. Witnesses observed the jumper attempting to clear the line twists during the entire canopy descent. The canopy remained in a fast spin until the jumper struck the ground. First responders gave him immediate medical attention, and professional medical personnel arrived soon after but declared him dead at the scene. Investigators reported that responders found the main canopy still attached to the jumper’s harness with several twists in the suspension lines and both brakes released. His cutaway handle was in place on the harness. The reserve ripcord handle was off of the harness by just a few inches, most likely dislodged by the impact, and the reserve cable was still inside of the housing. The impact had also opened the reserve container. Investigators found the freebag beside the jumper with the lines still stowed in the pouch. The reserve closing loop was intact. The container was equipped with an automatic activation device, which was turned on but had not activated the cutter.;Although the jumper deployed at an altitude of 3,500 feet, which provided plenty of time and altitude for initiating emergency procedures, the jumper never attempted to pull his cutaway handle or reserve ripcord. He may have lost altitude awareness as he worked to clear the line twists from the main canopy. Wingsuit jumpers must unzip their arm wings to reach the risers after deployment (whether to unstow the toggles after a normal opening or to grab the risers to help clear line twists). However, wingsuit designs allow jumpers to pull their cutaway and reserve handles without having to waste time unzipping their arm wings. In this case, the jumper unzipped both his arm and leg wings while under canopy and attempted to clear the line twists for the remainder of the canopy descent. The manufacturer’s operating instructions for the wingsuit state that if the main canopy opens with a malfunction, the jumper should put his legs together to collapse the leg wing then pull the cutaway handle and reserve ripcord without wasting time to release the arm wings. The increase in this jumper’s rotation speed and descent rate at 1,000 feet was likely due to an attempt to release the brakes while the canopy was still in line twists. Pulling steering lines through a line twist will usually trap the brake line in a lower position and cause the canopy to turn. The more the jumper pulls the line down, the harder the canopy will turn. This jumper was flying a semi-elliptical main canopy at a wing loading of 1.6:1. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 6-9 recommends a docile main canopy at a wing loading of 1.3:1 or less for jumpers who are new to wingsuiting. Although this jumper had completed at least 200 wingsuit jumps, a larger and more docile main canopy would have been easier to manage during a malfunction. In this case, the jumper should have either performed his emergency procedures immediately or released his arm wings and attempted to clear the line twists until reaching his decision altitude for emergency procedures. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that students and A-licensed skydivers decide and execute emergency procedures by 2,500 feet above the ground, and B- through D-license holders should do so by 1,800 feet. Altitude awareness is important for all phases of skydiving but particularly when facing an emergency situation.

She initiated a 45-degree turn to the right at approximately 50 feet above the ground, presumably in order to face directly into the wind for landing. Just after the jumper initiated the turn, witnesses on the ground observed her canopy partially deflate and begin to spin. It then re-inflated but dove at the ground, rapidly losing altitude. The jumper tried to stop the spin by pulling on the left steering toggle, but there was not enough altitude remaining to gain control of the canopy, and she struck the ground very hard in a diving turn. The hard landing killed her instantly. Later review of footage from a security camera revealed that the jumper passed through a dust devil—a vertically rotating column of air—just before landing. Because the dust devil had formed over a grass area, it was initially invisible because it had picked up little to no debris. A few seconds after the jumper struck the ground, the dust devil became visible as it passed from the grass landing area to a dirt surface, where it picked up dirt and dust particles.;This jumper passed through the turbulent, invisible dust devil at the worst possible time—just before landing. With very little altitude remaining once her canopy collapsed, she had no chance to regain control and recover to straight-and-level flight before striking the ground. Had she passed through the dust devil at a higher altitude, she would have had more time to gain control of her canopy. However, because the rapidly rising and swirling winds that formed above the grass area had picked up no debris, the dust devil was difficult to see and avoid. Investigators reported that the temperature at the time of the incident was 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit) and winds were 4 to 14 mph. Dust devils typically form on light-wind days such as this, when the sun warms two dissimilar surfaces such as grass and tarmac. The air above the different surfaces heats at different rates, which causes the rising air to begin to rotate into a mini-tornado called a dust devil. They are common in desert areas and usually easy to see and avoid because of the debris they pick up. However, in this case, the dust devil formed over an area of grass, which made it nearly impossible to see before the canopy crossed its path.;10.970694904911475;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done

His exit, deployment and initial canopy descent were uneventful. He initiated a 270-degree right turn at an unspecified altitude to begin his high-performance approach into the canopy course. The jumper pulled down on both front risers through the turn to change the pitch of the canopy and increase its speed and descent rate. Investigators reported that the turn appeared to be going well, stating that the jumper initiated his turn at an appropriate altitude and that he was in a good position over the course. As the diving canopy began to pick up speed through its recovery arc, witnesses on the ground observed the jumper release his front risers and pull down on his rear risers to adjust the pitch of the canopy and level it as he neared the ground. At this point, multiple suspension lines—two attached to the right front riser, one attached to the left front riser and one attached to the right rear riser—snapped. The canopy then began to spin uncontrollably for the final two or three seconds before the jumper struck the ground. The jumper died instantly from the impact.;Investigators reported that the jumper’s suspension lines were very worn and in need of replacement. His main canopy was equipped with very thin HMA (high-modulus aramid) 300-pound-strength suspension lines, which are used primarily by competitive canopy pilots to reduce drag. Because these lines are so thin, their users must replace them frequently to avoid this type of failure. The canopy manufacturer states that this type of suspension line requires frequent inspections and replacement in as few as 100-200 jumps. It also cautions that when this type of line wears beyond airworthiness, it is more likely to break during a high-performance approach than it is during deployment (because the forces on the lines will be higher during the approach than during opening shock). That was the case in this instance: The line failure occurred at a low altitude—during the jumper’s approach—and he did not have enough time to initiate emergency procedures before striking the ground. Flying small canopies at high wing loadings greatly increases the likelihood of injury or death if the landings do not go as planned. Jumpers who choose to pursue high-performance canopy flight must carefully consider whether it is worth the increased risk. Additionally, jumpers who use specialized gear must be aware of the limitations, additional risks and maintenance requirements that the equipment poses.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

All of the jumpers on the plane exited at 5,000 feet. A jumper who was not part of the class exited first, followed by the seven jumpers in the course and then the supervising jumper. The first eight jumpers to exit flew lightly loaded canopies, and the supervising jumper flew a highly loaded cross-braced canopy that descended much more quickly than the others. The drop zone at which this incident occurred has three landing areas: one for students, one for licensed jumpers and one for high-performance landings. This load of jumpers—including the supervising jumper—planned to land in the student landing area even though the supervising jumper reportedly planned to make a 450-degree turn as her final approach for a high-performance landing. She initiated the turn at an unreported altitude and, while rotating through the 180-degree point at an estimated 400-600 feet above the ground, collided with the first jumper to exit, who was then flying the base leg of his landing pattern. The two jumpers did not make body-to-body contact during the collision, and the jumper who was struck was uninjured, which indicates that the cross-braced canopy struck his suspension lines or risers and not his body. Although the collision caused his canopy to develop line twists, he cleared them and landed otherwise uneventfully. The impact with the lines or risers of the lower jumper’s canopy destroyed the colliding jumper’s cross-braced canopy, leaving only a few of the suspension lines attached. Her equipment did not include a reserve static line (RSL) or main-assisted-reserve-deployment (MARD) device. After the collision, she immediately released her main canopy and deployed her reserve, but there was not enough altitude remaining for the reserve to inflate before she struck the ground. The hard impact killed her instantly.;Canopy collisions are always chaotic. When one occurs at a low altitude, the chance of a successful cutaway and reserve deployment is low. It is difficult to determine whether an RSL or MARD would have made a difference in the outcome, since the jumper deployed her reserve immediately after cutting away and because an RSL or MARD device may not have worked correctly since only a few suspension lines remained attached to the main canopy. If the jumper had immediately deployed the reserve without taking the time to cut away, it may have provided additional time and altitude for inflation, but the reserve may have entangled with the main canopy. This jumper may have thought that she had descended past all of the other canopies when she initiated her turn to start her landing approach. However, this accident highlights how dangerous it is to fly a small, highly loaded canopy at high speeds near larger, slower canopies flying standard landing patterns. It is nearly impossible for high-performance canopy pilots to locate and avoid all canopies on a given load of jumpers, which is why in 2007 USPA began requiring all Group Member drop zones to separate those making high-performance landings from those flying standard patterns. Drop zones must achieve this separation through space (separate landing areas) or through time (separate passes for jumpers who are planning to make high-performance landings). The intent of this rule is to eliminate accidents such as this one. This separation strategy has proven to work well to lower the risks of canopy collisions, but it requires each jumper to know and follow the separation guidelines that the drop zone has established.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;Yes;8.0;No;done

He reportedly deployed his main canopy at 2,500 feet, and witnesses in the air reported that the canopy was turning when it initially opened but that the spinning stopped soon after the canopy inflated. Later investigations did not find anything wrong with the main canopy that would explain why it was turning on opening. Witnesses on the ground reported seeing the jumper’s reserve canopy deploy and inflate at approximately 600-800 feet. Upon initial inflation of the reserve, the two canopies entered into a side-by-side configuration. Investigators reported that the main and reserve canopies separated at approximately 200 feet above the ground and configured themselves into a downplane (in which the two canopies orbit around the jumper, causing the noses of the canopies to begin pointing toward the ground). The jumper attempted to control the spinning canopies by pulling on the steering lines of the main canopy, but the canopies continued in a fast spiral for the remainder of the descent. After striking the ground hard under the spinning canopies, the jumper received immediate medical attention, but the impact killed him instantly.;"Investigators found the reserve ripcord handle on the ground just 10 feet away from the jumper, which indicates that he pulled the handle and held onto it until impact or shortly prior to it. However, they could not determine whether the jumper pulled the handle intentionally or accidentally. They found no evidence of a malfunction that would have caused the jumper to pull his reserve nor did they find evidence of a situation that would have caused accidental deployment. They also could not determine when the handle was extracted: Though the reserve did not inflate until 800 feet, the jumper may have pulled the handle during or soon after main deployment; the relatively low drag conditions under the main could have caused the reserve pilot chute to trail behind him for a few minutes with the freebag remaining in the container. However, it’s also possible that he accidentally pulled the ripcord at 800 feet, and the reserve canopy immediately deployed. Ground witnesses observed the two canopies initially flying in a stable, side-by-side configuration, so the jumper probably decided to land under both rather than steer the main canopy away from the reserve and pull the cutaway handle to release the main. However, it is not unusual for side-by-side canopies to become unstable and downplane. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 contains recommendations for a two-canopies-out situation. For a downplane, it recommends disconnecting the reserve static line if altitude permits, then cutting away the main canopy and steering the reserve to a normal landing. Had the jumper pulled his cutaway handle as soon as the canopies began to downplane at 200 feet, he may have been able to release the main canopy and land under the reserve, but he had very little time to react, pull the cutaway handle, unstow the brakes of the reserve and land in a clear area. Although the canopies had not yet downplaned, he could also have made the decision to cut away the main when his reserve deployed at 800 feet, which would have allowed more time and altitude to deal with the situation. Jumpers should use caution during main deployment and inflation to guard against dislodging the cutaway or reserve ripcord handles. It is important for each jumper to become familiar with the various configurations main and reserve canopies can take in a two-out situation and the best response for each scenario. The Parachute Industry Association published the results of a study of dual-square-canopy deployments, which is available at pia.com/piapubs/tb/tb-261.pdf.

He had logged 16 previous wingsuit jumps. No one witnessed his exit, freefall, canopy deployment, or descent. When wingsuit jumpers on a later load the same day noticed a red parachute in a field near the airport, they notified drop zone personnel, who began searching. Until that time, no one realized that a jumper was missing. After a short search, investigators found the jumper in a supine position approximately three feet from his point of impact. His reserve parachute had at least partially opened since it was beside him and out of the freebag. However, the reserve slider was approximately four feet from the reserve risers, which indicates that the reserve had not fully inflated before the jumper struck the ground. The reserve freebag and pilot chute assembly were approximately 90 feet away and showed no signs of damage or friction burns. The reserve toggles were still stowed on the risers with the brakes set. The jumper’s chest and leg straps were properly threaded and adjusted. The reserve ripcord handle was dislodged from the harness, almost certainly from the impact, but approximately six inches of cable remained inside the ripcord housing. The main pilot chute was still secure in the pouch located at the bottom of the container. The main closing loop broke on impact, but the main deployment bag and main container flaps remained mostly in place. The automatic activation device displayed “Cut Rp,” which indicates activation, and it had cut the reserve closing loop. Investigators found the jumper’s extensively damaged helmet approximately 45 feet away from him. Additionally, the jumper had been wearing a helmet-mounted GoPro video camera, which investigators found at the scene, detached from the helmet. The jumper sustained multiple broken bones, including breaks to both ankles and both legs, and suffered blunt-force trauma to his chest and head. Medical first responders declared him dead at the scene.;Due to the nature of his injuries and the position of the slider, investigators concluded that the jumper struck the ground at a high rate of descent under a partially inflated reserve canopy. Although, in this case, the jumper’s impact was likely immediately fatal, drop zones should have a system in place to account for all jumpers after each load. To gather more information on the flight, they sent the jumper’s AAD to the manufacturer for inspection and extraction of data. They also collected data from his audible altimeter, which recorded detailed information regarding altitude and freefall speeds during the jump. Information gathered from the two devices indicated that the jumper’s initial wingsuit flight was stable and controlled. His freefall speeds were steady for 15- to 20-second periods followed by slight increases or decreases in speed consistent with the jumper making heading changes to fly the box pattern that the drop zone required for wingsuit flights. At approximately 4,500 feet, the jumper’s fall rate increased from 87 to 102 mph, which may indicate he was collapsing the wings of the suit in preparation for throwing the main pilot chute. At 3,200 feet, his freefall speed increased to 139 mph, which indicates possible instability. This rate of descent continued until approximately 1,600 feet, at which point his freefall speed slowed down and fluctuated between 73 and 95 mph. Investigators believe this may indicate that he regained controlled flight, although there is no way to know whether he was maintaining a heading or was in a flat spin. The AAD activated at approximately 840 feet, but the jumper’s freefall speed did not immediately change. His descent rate decreased—an indication that the reserve parachute had begun to inflate—at approximately 200 feet. There was no physical evidence indicating an entanglement (such as burns or damage to the reserve pilot chute or bridle) that would explain the delayed reserve opening. The wingsuit may have created a large burble above the back of the jumper that hindered the reserve pilot chute from extracting the freebag from the container for a few seconds. Investigators could not determine with certainty why the jumper, who held a B license, never manually deployed his main or reserve parachute. He may have lost altitude awareness as he struggled to regain control of the wingsuit. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that students and A-license holders decide upon and execute emergency procedures by 2,500 feet AGL, and B-, C- and D-license holders by 1,800 feet AGL. Although it is preferable to deploy a main or reserve parachute while in a stable body position, it is not the top priority. Even if this jumper deployed his main canopy while unstable, it might have opened without a malfunction, or if it did malfunction, he could have released the main canopy and landed under his reserve. Also, once he was below the decision height for executing emergency procedures without a deployed main, he should have deployed the reserve parachute regardless of his stability. When investigators found the detached video camera, it displayed “exit” on its screen, a message that reportedly appears when the camera is ejecting the memory card. The camera did not record during this jump. The jumper may have been trying to turn the camera on in the airplane and selected the wrong setting. Flying a wingsuit and a camera at the same time makes a jump a great deal more complicated for any skydiver, much less someone with only 294 jumps who is also new to wingsuiting. Jumpers who are learning a new discipline such as wingsuiting must train carefully and master the basic tasks of a safe exit, controlled flight, proper navigation, and stable deployment before adding additional challenges such as a camera. This jumper had reportedly completed only 16 jumps using a wingsuit. He had made at least four jumps using a different wingsuit geared toward beginner wingsuit flying. Investigators did not know precisely when he started jumping the wingsuit, which he was wearing for this jump. However, the incident report stated that observers had witnessed this jumper deploying in a head-low orientation on previous wingsuit jumps using this suit, a model that the manufacturer classifies as a beginner/intermediate wingsuit. Although this suit was classified as appropriate for a beginning wingsuit flyer, a more docile wingsuit may have been easier for the jumper to control during deployment. Jumping with wingsuits continues to grow in popularity, and many new jumpers take up this discipline once they reach the 200-jump minimum mandated by the Basic Safety Requirements. While many jumpers can take on the challenges of flying a wingsuit with as few as 200 jumps, some jumpers require more time and jumps to develop basic freefall skills and altitude awareness before taking on a wingsuit jump’s additional complications. A wingsuit coach approved by the manufacturer of the wingsuit is the best resource to help guide new jumpers through the process of choosing the correct wingsuit and learning to fly it correctly.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

After an uneventful freefall, the four jumpers deployed their main parachutes at unreported altitudes, and all four found themselves too far upwind of the drop zone to make it back to the main landing area. This jumper descended toward a farmer’s field.;This jumper was making his fourth jump on a new, semi-elliptical 129-square-foot canopy loaded at 1.5:1. He previously jumped a 150-square-foot, seven-cell non-elliptical canopy loaded at 1.3:1. The manufacturer classifies a canopy at a wing loading of 1.5:1 as high-performance and notes that flying one requires a high degree of experience and competence. With only 192 jumps and very little experience jumping a canopy at this wing loading, this jumper may have not realized how much altitude the canopy would lose in a hard turn initiated with either a steering toggle or front riser.

The report did not state whether this jumper left at or near the same time as the other two or if there was a delay, but five seconds after the exit he struck the leg of one of the other jumpers with his head. He was incapacitated following the impact, but it is not known whether the freefall collision caused fatal injuries or if he was simply knocked unconscious. The incapacitated jumper was wearing an open-face fiberglass helmet but was not using an automatic activation device. It had been removed for service the previous week.;When the jumper became incapacitated, the absence of an automatic activation device meant the jumper had little chance of a reserve deployment. The week before this fatal jump, the jumper had turned on his AAD at a drop zone with a field elevation of 1,600 feet mean sea level (MSL) and then traveled to this drop zone, which had a field elevation of 500 feet MSL. Because the AAD stayed on during the trip, it calibrated based on the higher altitude and fired at approximately 2,000 feet MSL, which is close to the AAD’s normal activation altitude plus the 1,100-foot altitude difference between the DZs. This resulted in AAD activation of the reserve canopy just after the jumper’s main canopy deployment. The AAD then required removal for servicing, and this jumper elected to use the rig without an AAD in the meantime. A jumper equipped with an AAD must read the entire operating manual to fully understand the device. An AAD must be turned on at the landing area altitude at which the jump is conducted in order for it to calibrate properly. Although the jumper’s misunderstanding of how his AAD functioned (and its subsequent activation and removal) did not directly cause this incident, it did remove the possibility of the jumper using the AAD when he needed it most as a back-up device.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;3.0;No;done

The pair had planned to separate at 4,500 feet, but video footage from a camera worn by this jumper revealed that the pair did not actually break off until 3,100 feet. The second jumper observed this jumper tracking away but did not watch him deploy. He then deployed his main canopy at an unreported altitude. He did not see the other jumper under canopy and neither did anybody on the ground, the pilot of the plane nor the tandem pair that exited before the 2-way. Drop zone personnel initiated a search and located the jumper about an hour and a half later in a field a mile from the drop zone. Investigators reported that they found the reserve canopy open next to the jumper on the ground with the reserve freebag approximately 150 feet away. The main canopy was still in the deployment bag in the container, although the main flaps were open because the main closing loop broke on impact. The main pilot chute was still stowed with about two inches extracted from its pocket at the bottom of the container. The impact with the ground had instantly killed the jumper.;Investigators reported that this jumper had recently returned to skydiving after a long layoff but did not specify the exact length of the layoff.

The deployment and initial canopy descent were normal. He proceeded to fly his canopy toward the west and made two spiraling turns at approximately 1,200 feet. Investigators reported that witnesses then observed him flying to the west for approximately five seconds before making an aggressive 90-degree turn in an unreported direction at a low altitude and striking the ground hard while his body was horizontal with the main canopy, which was still in a steep, diving turn. Investigators could not determine the exact altitude at which he started the turn nor whether he used a steering toggle or front riser to initiate it. He received immediate medical attention but died instantly from the hard impact.;Investigators reported that the jumper’s equipment was in excellent condition, weather was not a factor and he did not have a history of attempting high-performance landings.

They exited a Twin Otter flying at 13,500 feet for a jump similar to one of the jumps in Category E of the USPA Integrated Student Program, in which the student performs front flips and backflips to demonstrate recovering from instability. The student performed a non-gripped diving exit, and the instructor, who wore a video camera, followed him in freefall. Investigators reported that a “third party” later viewed the footage and described it to them but did not make the footage available for direct viewing. Reportedly, the student performed several front flips and recovered to a stable, belly-to-earth position after each one. However, at approximately 5,000 feet above ground level, the student was unable to regain stability after his fourth attempt at a front flip and began to spin and tumble as the instructor attempted to catch and assist him. The student tried to deploy his main parachute but could not locate the main pilot chute handle and pulled on part of the harness instead. Reportedly he did not noticeably check his altimeter as he continued in freefall. The instructor continued to attempt to dock with and assist the unstable and spinning student until the student’s automatic activation device initiated reserve deployment at approximately 810 feet AGL (according to data the AAD manufacturer later extracted from the unit). Apparently, the instructor then realized he was at a very low altitude and pulled his cutaway and reserve ripcord handles, although his AAD had already activated at approximately 787 feet AGL (according to data the manufacturer later extracted from the unit). Before their reserves could fully inflate and slow their descents, the jumpers struck the ground approximately 50 feet apart from each other. The hard impact killed them both instantly.;Investigators reported that this student made a tandem jump in the previous year and completed seven uneventful student jumps in the last week. According to investigators, the student did not make any noticeable altimeter checks during this skydive. The report did not mention whether the instructor signaled the student to check his altimeter at any point during the jump. All skydivers must make frequent altimeter checks, especially students since they are not familiar with freefall or how the ground looks from certain altitudes. In this case, the student may have been so focused on trying to get stable and stop his spin that he forgot to check his altitude. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 4 recommends that students check their altimeters continually every few seconds, after every task, when encountering difficulty completing the current task and whenever uncertain of altitude. The instructor also apparently lost altitude awareness as he was attempting to catch the student, presumably to assist with stability and main-canopy deployment. According to the USPA Instructional Rating Manual, instructors must never chase a student below the minimum deployment altitude of 2,000 feet. In addition to ensuring the instructor has an open parachute at a minimum altitude, the instructor’s deployment also provides a clear signal to the student that he is at a dangerously low altitude and must deploy a parachute immediately. Data extracted from both AADs showed that the cutters activated nearly simultaneously, at 810 feet for the student and 787 feet for the instructor. The average speed during the skydive was 123 mph for both jumpers. However, the speeds were higher below 1,200 feet and even showed a slight increase after cutter activation. This additional speed may have been a factor in the jumpers striking the ground before the reserve canopies could fully inflate. Local police held the parachute equipment, and the incident report submitted to USPA did not state whether a parachute rigger or manufacturer ever inspected the equipment. The police also confiscated the video footage, and the report did not indicate whether an industry expert had an opportunity to inspect the footage either before or after the police released it. The manufacturer did receive the AADs for analysis. The Parachute Industry Association continues to look into delayed reserve openings to try to determine why, in approximately 11 instances, reserves did not fully inflate after AADs activated at their designed altitudes.;0.5583938648415117;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;No;done

The instructor was sitting next to the pilot facing toward the back of the plane with his student hooked up directly in front of him. To exit, the student put his legs outside the door on the step above the aircraft’s right main landing gear, and the instructor rolled out the door to drop behind the right main landing gear’s strut. Video from the instructor’s hand-mounted camera helped investigators determine the chain of events for this skydive. Before the tandem pair exited, the male end of one of the seatbelts fell between the instructor’s harness and the drogue-release cable’s metal housing. As the instructor dropped away from the airplane, the seatbelt hung up on the metal housing, which stretched the housing to more than three times its regular 12-inch length before the seatbelt cleared it, and the pair dropped away from the plane and into freefall. The distortion of the housing and the tension applied to the side of the tandem rig caused the main container flaps to open and the main bag to escape from the container. The tandem pair was now in freefall with a horseshoe malfunction, with the main bag trailing above the tandem instructor’s back and the drogue still in its pouch. The drogue then extracted from its pouch and entangled around the drogue-release cable’s housing. Investigators could not determine whether the instructor located the drogue and attempted to throw it or if the trailing main bag pulled on the bridle and extracted the drogue. The instructor pulled the reserve ripcord 10 seconds after exiting, at approximately 5,500 to 6,000 feet. He did not pull the cutaway handle. The reserve canopy remained in the freebag, trapped by the partially inflated main canopy, which was still in a horseshoe configuration. The canopies remained entangled for the remainder of the freefall, with the main canopy only partially inflated. The tandem pair struck the roof of a garage and then dropped to the ground. The hard impact killed both the instructor and student instantly.;Investigators reported that the instructor exited from a seated position at the door of the Cessna 182 without first performing a handle-check of the equipment. Leaving from a seated position makes it difficult to perform a proper handle-check. Exiting from a poised position in the door would have provided the instructor a better opportunity to check his handles, as well as possibly discover that the seatbelt was entangled around the drogue-release cable’s housing. The 7,500-foot AGL exit provided the tandem instructor very little time to assess the situation. An exit at a higher altitude would have provided the instructor more time to evaluate the problem and work through a solution. The instructor may have felt rushed, knowing that he had relatively little freefall altitude remaining before he needed to deploy a parachute. Following the horseshoe malfunction and drogue entanglement, the instructor pulled the reserve ripcord in an attempt to deploy the reserve parachute. The manufacturer’s procedures for a horseshoe malfunction are for the instructor to pull the reserve-static-line shackle, pull the cutaway handle, attempt to clear the main risers off of the harness, and then pull the reserve ripcord. Clearing as much of the risers and lines as possible off of the container improves the odds of a successful reserve deployment in this situation. With the drogue still caught on the drogue release handle, when the freebag containing the reserve canopy and the partially inflated main entangled, no other options remained. Investigators reported that this was the 16th tandem of the day and the third full day of tandem jumping for the instructor. Fatigue may have been a factor in the accident. Tandem skydiving can be physically challenging, and it is essential for tandem instructors to assess carefully when they are too tired to continue making tandem jumps and rest when necessary.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;Yes;done

However, he was making only his second jump on a new harness-and-container system, which included new main risers with different front-riser dive loops and steering toggles than he used previously. The differences in the size and location of the loops compared to what he was accustomed to may have been a factor in why he accidentally let go of the left toggle as he transitioned from front to rear risers. Investigators reported that if he had continued in a straight direction at the time he attempted to flare, the landing may have been survivable. However, pulling down just the right toggle as he attempted to flare the canopy caused it to continue in a right-hand turn.

He then reached up and pulled the drawstrings to collapse his slider, grabbed both steering toggles and pulled down to release his main canopy’s brakes. The left side released normally, but the right-side toggle remained trapped in the cat’s eye (the finger-trapped opening about two feet up the steering line that holds the toggle in place when packed). The canopy began to spin to the right as the jumper repeatedly attempted to release the right brake by pulling on the toggle. However, the right toggle remained trapped, and the spin continued. The jumper pulled on the left riser several times in an apparent attempt to stop the spin, but he never pulled the left steering line down. If he had pulled the left steering line down to the point where the cat’s eye was even with the guide ring (to match the length of the trapped right steering line), it would most likely have stopped the spin.;Investigators reported that the right steering line’s cat’s eye fit unusually snugly onto the end of the toggle, which caused it to lock against the toggle when the canopy inflated and applied tension to the steering line. The report stated that this jumper’s left steering line, which released correctly, had been replaced at some point, but the right steering line appeared to be original and had a smaller than normal cat’s eye (possibly due to wear and shrinkage). The right toggle released easily on the ground when there was no tension on the steering line. Steering toggles must release smoothly while under tension of an inflated canopy.

He received immediate medical attention, but emergency responders declared him dead at the scene.;At least one witness in the air reported that the main canopy began a slow rotation soon after opening and that the jumper was slumped in his harness, unresponsive. The rotation was most likely due to the uneven loading of the harness caused by the jumper leaning to one side. He was jumping a 150-square-foot canopy at a wing loading of 1.3:1. Even though the rotation was slight, striking the ground in a turn under a canopy at this wing loading without flaring to slow the descent generated significant energy.

The two jumpers struck body-to-body, which led to an entanglement of their main canopies. Investigators reported that the jumpers involved in the canopy collision had both made spiraling turns shortly after opening, which resulted in their being at nearly the same altitude just before the collision.;While canopy collisions most commonly occur immediately after deployment or near the intersection of the base leg and final-approach leg just before landing, this incident shows that a canopy collision can occur at any point during the canopy descent.

The canopy reportedly opened with a line-over malfunction and began to spin after inflation.;This jumper was a very current and active skydiver, and he deployed his main canopy at an altitude that would have allowed for successful reserve deployment had he immediately and correctly performed his emergency procedures. Investigators do not know why he stayed with the main parachute until he was at such a low altitude, but he may have been attempting to clear the line-over malfunction and lost altitude awareness while working to correct the problem.

This jumper was the third of four jumpers who exited on this pass. The other three jumpers were experienced skydivers with an unreported number of jumps, and they were not a factor in this jumper’s exit.;Investigators reported that the Cessna Caravan was in a full-power, climbing configuration as the jumpers began to exit at 5,000 feet. One jumper in the airplane reported that a tandem instructor seated toward the front attempted unsuccessfully to stop the student before he exited. Another jumper reported that the pilot was busy looking for the open canopies of jumpers from another airplane and was not aware that the jumpers in his plane had started to exit on the low pass.

He struck the ground hard, approximately 100 feet short of the edge of the landing area. He received immediate medical attention, but the impact killed him instantly, and medical personnel declared him dead at the scene.;Investigators reported that this jumper—who had completed 594 jumps in a 16-year period—was flying a 90-square-foot cross-braced canopy at a wing loading of 2.1:1. He had at least one long layoff from skydiving, having returned to the sport 16 months prior to this incident after a four-year break. After this jumper returned to the sport, he almost immediately switched from jumping a 120-square-foot elliptical canopy to a 90-square-foot cross-braced canopy. During the 16 months following his break, he made approximately 100 jumps. Additionally, this jumper was at a drop zone with a field elevation of 5,177 feet, and the reported density altitude at the time of the incident was 6,900 feet.

The first formation was a 16-way diamond, which built successfully. The top jumper (called the “pilot”) released from the two canopies below him to dock on the bottom of the formation and create the second point. While the top jumper flew to the bottom to re-dock, the formation became a 15-way with two pilots flying side by side at its top. Reportedly, the formation was very stable until approximately 6,000 feet, when it flew into an area of turbulent air. This created a wave of movement through the canopy formation. The pilot of the canopy on the left side (as seen from behind the formation) was then flying several feet lower than the right-side pilot.;Investigators reported that this accident occurred in the middle of the afternoon, when air is typically more turbulent due to solar heating (when air near ground level heats and rises into the cooler air above). Although turbulence can occur at any altitude and at any time of day, air is generally smoother in the early morning, which tends to be a better time for canopy formation skydives.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;Yes;No;16.0;Yes;done

The jumper’s main canopy opened with line twists and a line-over malfunction. Witnesses on the ground observed the canopy in a relatively slow turn with the line-over squeezing the center of the canopy into a bow-tie configuration. The jumper attempted to get out of the line twists as the canopy continued to descend while rotating slowly. At approximately 500 feet, he pulled his cutaway handle to release his main canopy and pulled his reserve ripcord after he had dropped approximately 150 feet from the main. His reserve canopy deployed and had just inflated as he struck the ground. The impact killed him instantly.;This jumper presumably lost altitude awareness as he worked to clear the line twists from his main canopy. With the main canopy mostly inflated and flying in a slow rotation, he may not have realized that the canopy had a line-over malfunction, because he was focused on getting out of the line twists. Or perhaps he thought if he cleared the line twists he could then work on clearing the line-over. Regardless, he allowed himself to descend far below the 1,800-foot decision altitude for emergency procedures USPA recommends in Section 5-1 of the Skydiver’s Information Manual.

The jumper’s exit and freefall were uneventful, and another jumper’s video footage showed him to be in control and aware throughout the entire freefall. The group broke off from one another at 4,500 feet as planned, and at an unknown altitude, this jumper deployed his main canopy. Upon deployment, his left brake line snapped apart approximately 12 inches below the cascade. This put the jumper in a hard spin to the right with his body orbiting around the canopy nearly horizontal to the ground. A witness in the air observed him in this spin at approximately 2,000 feet above the ground. At an unknown altitude, the jumper released his main canopy by pulling his cutaway handle, which placed him back into freefall. Nobody in the air or on the ground observed the cutaway, but witnesses on the ground saw him tumbling and unstable in freefall from what they estimate was 900 feet until he reached the ground. The impact killed him instantly.;"Investigators found the main canopy with the right-side steering line released and found the broken left-side steering line and toggle in a different location. The main canopy may have opened hard and snapped the line, but investigators also reported that the main canopy and suspension lines were worn, and the suspension lines were in need of replacement.

She was then at an altitude described as low (the exact altitude is unknown) and directly facing buildings and an asphalt parking lot containing other obstacles. Investigators believe that she may have been focusing on landing near visiting family members. However, she was too low to do so and still fly a structured pattern with a base leg and final approach that would allow her to face back into the wind. She elected to make an aggressive 180-degree turn and struck the ground at nearly the same time as the canopy while in a hard dive.;As with almost any fatal accident, a chain of events led to the outcome of this jump.

He then pulled down evenly on both front risers, presumably to increase his forward speed before flaring the canopy for landing. Investigators reported that this was not uncommon for the jumper; he had used this landing technique many times in the past. At approximately 50 feet, the canopy made a sudden, diving turn to the left, and the jumper struck the ground at nearly the same time as the canopy. A ground witness reported seeing the jumper reach up toward the right steering toggle, apparently reaching to grab it when it slipped out of his hand as he released his front risers and started to flare the canopy. Investigators found him on the ground with his left steering toggle still in his hand, but with his right hand empty. He received immediate medical attention but died instantly from the hard landing, having suffered multiple blunt-force traumas.";Investigators reported that this jumper commonly held his steering toggles with just three fingers rather than placing both hands entirely through the toggles and gripping them in his palms. A toggle held by just the fingers can easily slip off the ends of the fingers, especially if the jumper is also attempting to manipulate the front riser with the same fingers used for gripping the toggle. Jumpers should place the entirety of their hands through each steering toggle and grasp the toggles in their palms. This will help ensure that the toggles stay in their hands throughout the entire canopy descent. Those who choose to use front risers to control their canopies should grip the toggles in their palms with their ring and pinky fingers clasped around the toggles. This leaves the index and middle fingers free to grab the front risers without the jumper losing grip on the toggles.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;Yes;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

Witnesses on the ground reported that the canopy changed heading several times during the descent but that it was not flying a predictable pattern. As the jumper approached the landing area, witnesses on the ground observed that he was hanging limp in the harness and was not steering the canopy. The canopy flew straight and level for the last part of the descent, but the jumper did not flare and impacted hard. Investigators reported that they found both brakes in the stowed position. The jumper received immediate medical attention, but medical personnel declared him dead at the scene. Although the jumper incurred extensive injuries from the landing, investigators suspect that he suffered a heart attack or other medical emergency during his canopy descent. There was no autopsy, so it was not possible to determine the exact cause of death.;The report did not state whether this jumper had previously experienced any medical issues or if there was a family history of health problems. Skydiving places additional stress on the heart and body, which requires jumpers to stay on top of any possible medical problems and to be willing to stay on the ground until the issue is resolved. As the skydiving population ages, there will likely be an increase in the number of jumpers who experience medical issues during their skydives. Since 2000, USPA has received 19 reports of fatalities that investigators attributed to medical problems in freefall or under canopy. Most medical professionals recommend a thorough annual physical exam for people who are 40 and older.

He was following at least one other jumper who had flown the same approach and landing, but that jumper was not a factor in the accident. Witnesses on the ground stated that he initiated his turn at an altitude that was too low and out of the position necessary for his swoop to align properly with the narrow path between the obstacles, but the report did not state the actual altitude of the start of the turn. Before he completed the 270-degree turn, spectators observed him starting to apply both brakes. Most likely, it was at this point that he realized he was too low to continue the turn and applied brakes in an effort to stop his descent and get the canopy flying level with the ground. However, he still had a high rate of descent and forward speed and was flying directly at the hangar and some spectators. He then initiated a 90-degree right turn in an apparent attempt to land in a clear area. The last-second turn caused him to lose additional altitude, and he struck the side of a drainage ditch while still descending steeply and moving quickly.

Because his wing loading was the highest of the group, he was to delay his deployment for seven seconds and land first. The others in the group were to make successively shorter delays and land in a specific order.

After an uneventful exit from the airplane, the group began building a 6-way round. This jumper was already docked with three other jumpers in the formation when a fourth jumper docked with forward momentum. This caused the formation to move under a fifth jumper who was ready to dock on the formation but had not yet taken grips. The fifth jumper, who was a few feet above the formation, slipped into its burble, which caused him to lose altitude rapidly.

He was wearing a helmet-mounted video camera, which helped investigators determine what happened during the subsequent canopy descent.;This jumper had experienced several spinning malfunctions in the past and had always successfully cut away and deployed his reserve canopy. This indicates that he was no stranger to this type of malfunction or performing the appropriate emergency procedures. In this instance, the canopy lost altitude at a rate of about 54 feet per second, which left very little time for the jumper to recognize the problem, locate his emergency handles and perform emergency procedures.

Investigators believe he deployed soon after the exit, but the exact altitude is unknown. One non-skydiver witness reported that the canopy opened and started a slow spin that kept accelerating until impact. Another witness, a skydiver, reported that the canopy was in a spin and the jumper did not appear to be taking any action to stop it. The second witness watched the canopy continue to spin until it was out of sight behind a tree line.;Investigators inspected the parachute equipment and found it to be in good condition. The main canopy was almost new, with only a handful of jumps made on it. The right steering line was broken 30 inches below the cascade attachment point leading to the tail of the canopy. Because of the type of break and the condition of the steering line, investigators believe that the main canopy opened very hard, causing the brake line to snap. With one brake line broken, a canopy would begin to spin immediately after inflation, which is what witnesses on the ground had observed in this case. Investigators found both steering toggles mounted on the rear risers with the brakes stowed and the cutaway and reserve ripcord handles securely mounted on the main lift webs. This is consistent with witness observations that the jumper under the spinning main canopy did not move or take any action.;;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

No one observed the actual deployment of her canopy.;Investigators could not determine whether the jumper had released the left brake or if it had come unstowed on its own during deployment. They believe that the jumper deployed her main canopy in an unstable body position and that the right main riser caught on the jumper’s helmet. This prevented the riser from fully deploying and actually pulled it in at an angle that caused the riser cover to envelop the 3-ring system.

Investigators report that he initiated a 270-degree turn at an unknown altitude for his final approach. Investigators do not know whether he initiated the turn with riser or toggle input or whether he tried to flare the canopy to stop his steep descent. He struck the pond surface while the canopy was in a steep, diving turn and came to a stop in the water. First responders and ambulance personnel gave him immediate medical attention. However, he was pronounced dead upon reaching the hospital, reportedly due to a broken neck and severed spinal column.;Previously, this jumper had been performing swoop-style landings and had completed approximately 500 jumps with a 99-square-foot elliptical canopy. He had recently started jumping smaller, cross-braced canopies. After just a few jumps under a 96-square-foot cross-braced canopy, he began jumping an 87-square-foot cross-braced canopy from a different manufacturer, which he used for this skydive. This was his fourth or fifth jump on this canopy, which he loaded at 2.1:1. The report did not state whether he had ever received canopy coaching in a structured program.

Although witnesses did not report his exact altitude, they stated that it appeared he started his turn “too low.” One of the witnesses—an experienced swooper who was watching from the ground—stated that when the jumper started his second 360-degree rotation, it was clear he was too low to complete it safely. He expected the jumper to abort his maneuver rather than continue the turn. However, the jumper continued his turn through the second 360-degree rotation, at which point he was at a very low altitude and still diving steeply at the ground.;This jumper was current and very experienced with high-performance canopy flight and landings. He had completed approximately 150 jumps with this canopy, and he was familiar with its flight characteristics. Investigators reported that he had made three jumps earlier that day using the same 720-degree approach. He was slightly low on each of those jumps, requiring him to flare the canopy with his toggles earlier in his canopy’s recovery arc than ideal so he could slow his descent rate and level the canopy with the ground.

His instructor observed the deployment of the student’s main canopy and reported that it appeared normal, with the canopy flying straight without spinning or turning, as it fully inflated. As the instructor flew her own canopy toward the landing area, she looked back and noticed her student in a steep, spiraling turn.;Investigators inspected the student’s equipment and found the right brake line released and the left brake line stowed. This would cause the canopy to spin to the left. Since the instructor observed the canopy initially flying straight, either the right brake released soon after inflation, or the jumper released the right brake but not the brake on the left. Investigators inspected the equipment and could not find any problems that would have prohibited the student from releasing the brake during his descent.

Investigators did not report the altitude of her deployment, but they did state that she opened far upwind of the drop zone landing area due to a long spot. The jumper immediately started flying her canopy back toward the drop zone. She crossed a road and power lines at approximately 150 feet, still flying downwind, to make it to the main landing area. At an altitude reported to be between 30 and 50 feet, she initiated a left toggle turn in an apparent attempt to face into the 10-to-15-knot wind for landing and then returned the left toggle to its full-flight position. At that point, the left side of her body struck the ground in a steep, diving turn at the same time as the nose of her canopy. First responders found her unconscious and breathing shallowly, with multiple broken bones and head and facial injuries. She received immediate medical attention, but soon after she arrived at the hospital, medical personnel declared her deceased.;Ultimately, the fatal error this jumper made was the low-altitude turn she performed in an apparent attempt to face into the wind for landing.

The three jumpers planned to land in a specific order, with each jumper performing a 270-degree downwind landing across a pond. There was no other canopy traffic in the area.;These jumpers created a plan for landing that would have allowed them to have clear airspace for each of their high-performance approaches and landings. However, after their openings following a long freefall, the jumper slated to land second was the lowest canopy. This made it difficult to follow the original landing plan, but jumper one still made an attempt to land first. Consequently, both jumpers reached their pattern-entry altitudes at close to the same time. Since both jumpers were flying highly wing-loaded, cross-braced canopies, which can cover long distances in short periods of time, they very quickly closed the 300-foot horizontal distance between them. At this point, rather than trying to initiate the high-performance landings, one or both jumpers (provided both jumpers knew where the other was located) should have aborted the plan and landed conservatively in a clear area.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;3.0;No;done

The airplane had 18 jumpers on board, but the others were not a factor in this accident. After their freefalls and initial canopy descents, the two jumpers descended toward the drop zone landing area at nearly the same time and altitude. Both flew small canopies loaded at approximately 2:1. For his final approach, jumper one faced north and flew a straight path into the wind. At this point, jumper two, who was above and behind jumper one, initiated a 90-degree right-hand turn toward his final approach. As jumper two completed his turn approximately 250 feet above the ground, he collided into the back of jumper one. Jumper two’s body struck the suspension lines and trailing edge of jumper one’s canopy and then passed through the suspension lines. This caused both parachutes to collapse and rotate. The two canopies remained entangled, spinning violently, until the jumpers struck the ground. Both jumpers received immediate medical attention. Medical personnel then transported them to the local hospital in separate ambulances. Later that day, jumper one died of his injuries while still in surgery. Jumper two suffered multiple broken bones and internal injuries but expects to make a full recovery.;These two jumpers ended up in the same airspace as they prepared to land, even though they exited in different groups from the same Twin Otter. Both were jumping high-performance canopies loaded at 2:1, which cover a lot of vertical and horizontal distance in a short amount of time. Although the jumpers’ wing loadings were similar, jumper two’s 90-degree turn caused him to lose altitude and gain significant forward speed in comparison to jumper one prior to the collision. Any turn under canopy increases the risk of a collision with another jumper. Jumpers must carefully scan the areas in the direction of their turns to make sure their airspace is clear.

The jumper, who was wearing a video camera that remained running after his deployment, initially steered his canopy toward the drop zone using rear risers, leaving his brakes stowed. Once he was facing the drop zone, he aggressively pulled the slider drawstrings and collapsed the slider. He pulled the drawstrings with such force that he pulled the slider grommets past the soft links at the top of his risers and over the steering toggles stowed on the rear risers. As the left slider grommet passed over the left steering toggle, it pulled the toggle loose, unstowing the left brake. This caused the canopy to begin spiraling to the right, since the right toggle was still stowed on the riser.;Because the jumper was wearing a video camera that was turned on for the entire canopy descent, investigators could determine what happened on this jump. The jumper was apparently trying to collapse his slider by pulling on the drawstrings but was not trying to pull the slider all the way down his risers. The main risers were type-17, 1-inch-wide main risers, with soft links attaching the canopy lines to each riser. Many jumpers use this type of riser and line attachment, which makes it possible to pull the slider down past the steering toggles and for the slider to be twisted up and tucked behind the jumper’s neck. Jumpers who wish to collapse the slider but leave it at the top of the risers should use slider stops that will prevent the slider from moving past the tops of the risers. Stowing the slider behind the head reduces the drag on the main canopy and also improves visibility during canopy flight.

Investigators found that his main deployment handle, main cutaway handle and reserve ripcord handle were in place on his harness-and-container system, and when they performed testing on the ground, they easily extracted all of the handles. Investigators discovered that the automatic activation device (AAD) cutter had severed the reserve closing loop.

It is estimated that the two jumpers were about 100 yards apart when they initially deployed. The impact occurred just as the second jumper’s canopy had finished opening.;On this skydive, several factors led to a fatal outcome. As with almost every fatality, changing one or more of the factors may have changed the result. First, the group reportedly broke off at 3,500 feet above the ground, which most experts would consider very low for a 16-way skydive. Skydiver’s Information Manual (SIM) Section 6-1 recommends that groups of six or more begin breaking off at least 2,000 feet above the highest planned deployment altitude.

At approximately 50 to 70 feet above the ground, he crossed over an asphalt taxiway while performing a left-hand turn to face into the wind for his final approach and landing. Witnesses described the maneuver as a flat turn: The jumper initially had both brakes pulled down near his shoulders, and he initiated the turn by pulling down farther on the left toggle. Reportedly, the winds at the time of this jumper’s landing were 12 knots gusting to 20 knots (approximately 14 mph gusting to 23 mph). He may have been flying in half brakes to conserve altitude so that he could make his intended landing area, a spot just downwind from a 15-foot-high earthen berm located beside the taxiway he had just crossed.;Another jumper who was descending at the same time also reported experiencing a partial canopy collapse during his descent. He landed uneventfully in a different area of the drop zone. The jumper who died selected a clear landing area, but it was located directly downwind of a 15-foot-tall berm. The strong and gusty wind may have created additional turbulence above and downwind of the berm as it was blowing across. The additional turbulence may have caused the partial collapse of the canopy and its subsequent direction change and loss of altitude.

The reserve opened very hard, which was painful but did not cause serious injury. Based on this, investigators suspected that on this jump, he may have again had difficulty reaching the hackey-style handle for his main pilot chute and lost altitude awareness while he continued to try to deploy his main canopy in an effort to avoid another painful reserve deployment.

The regular landing area was a large field near a beach, and the house and pond were located downwind of the landing area. Winds were strong and gusty as he was landing. A nearby airport weather station recorded winds at 21 knots (24 mph) gusting to 28 knots (32 mph) around that time. He flew his canopy directly over the townhouse on the base leg of his final descent and initiated a 90-degree left turn at approximately 150 feet for his final approach toward the pond. Midway through the turn, the canopy partially deflated as the nose on the left side of the canopy deformed and rolled under, causing the canopy to turn hard to the left and rapidly lose altitude. This placed the jumper directly over the townhouse in a steep dive with no time or altitude remaining for any sort of correction. His body impacted the roof at the same time as the nose of his canopy. His body broke through the surface of the roof and broke at least one of the support trusses, and he came to a stop in the attic of the townhouse. He suffered severe head injuries and multiple broken bones, including a broken arm and compound fracture of his left femur. He received immediate medical attention but died at the scene.;This jumper was jumping a 90-square-foot cross-braced canopy at a wing loading of 2.0:1 in very strong, gusty winds. He selected a landing pattern that placed him directly above the townhouse, where the gusting winds, likely further disrupted from passing over the townhouse, apparently caused his canopy to partially deflate. A safer option, given the wind conditions at the time he was jumping, would have been to choose a spot in the landing area as far as possible from any trees or buildings. The descent rate and forward speed generated by a canopy under such a high wing loading provide little to no room for error while landing. Any changes to the wing shape of a canopy with such a small surface area, such as those distortions caused by turbulence, will greatly affect the canopy flight. When this occurs at a low altitude, such as in this case, there is not enough time or altitude for the canopy to recover.

When the jumper reached for his toggles, his right hand passed through the loop of excess brake line. When he pulled both hands down to release his brakes, the right brake line knotted through one of the elastic toggle keepers, locking the steering line to the riser.

This left the jumper with no other option than to land the main canopy with the right steering line disabled. He later said he planned to land using his rear risers to flare. He flew the canopy over several obstacles toward the main landing area. In an effort to land facing into the 15- to 20-mph wind, he initiated a left-hand turn that was reportedly between 180 and 270 degrees, starting the turn at approximately 100 feet above the ground.

Emergency responders airlifted him to a hospital, where he died a few hours later from his injuries.;Investigators reported that this jumper had a lot of experience jumping an elliptical canopy, but he had recently downsized to a smaller, 103-square-foot cross-braced canopy. Most cross-braced canopies fly very differently from elliptical models. For example, given the same size and wing loading, cross-braced canopies will lose altitude more quickly during a turn and remain in a dive longer than an elliptical canopy.

Both jumpers then turned toward the south for final approach at nearly the same time, with this jumper making a right turn and the second jumper making a left turn. Immediately after both jumpers completed their turns to final approach, the nose of this jumper’s canopy struck the back of the second jumper’s canopy approximately 100 feet above the ground. Several cells of the second jumper’s canopy, which was in front, collapsed but quickly re-inflated, and the second jumper was able to land conventionally.

Reportedly, both were fixated on the landing area, and they apparently did not see each other before colliding. The first jumper was flying an elliptical canopy at a wing loading of 1.7:1, and it appears that he was flying more quickly than the second jumper (whose wing loading was not reported), by virtue of the fact that he struck the second jumper from behind. Small, highly wing-loaded canopies will quickly cover large distances and make it difficult to negotiate heavy canopy traffic.

The jumper faced into the wind but due to its strength, began to fly backward under canopy. Winds on the ground were reported to be 20 miles per hour. The winds aloft were not reported, but another jumper on the same load who had a slightly heavier wing loading stated that he was unable to make any penetration into the wind until he descended below 500 feet.;Jumping in strong wind adds considerable risk to any skydive. In this case, until the jumper was below 500 feet, the wind speed was greater than the forward speed of the jumper’s canopy (which was lightly wing loaded at 0.87:1). Even below 500 feet it was likely that she was making little forward progress due to the 20-mph ground winds and her lightly loaded canopy. Jumpers need to consider winds aloft as well as ground winds when planning for a jump.

Witnesses on the ground and in the air reported seeing the main canopy begin to spin immediately after deployment but did not report the speed or direction of the spin. The spin continued until the jumper pulled his cutaway handle and released the main canopy approximately 100 feet above the ground. He then went back into freefall momentarily and was killed instantly when he impacted the asphalt surface of a taxiway.;Following the incident, investigators found the main canopy with both brakes still stowed, and there was no indication of what caused the main canopy to spin. In the event of an uncontrollable main canopy, Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 recommends that B- through D-licensed jumpers release the main canopy and deploy the reserve parachute by at least 1,800 feet AGL. (Students and A-licensed jumpers must deploy their reserves by at least 2,500 feet.) Investigators could not determine why this jumper waited so long before releasing the main parachute.

The jumper struck the ground at a high descent rate while the canopy was still in a steep dive. He experienced multiple broken bones, including a compound fracture of his left femur and facial-bone fractures, and a brain injury. He was airlifted to a local hospital. The incident report did not indicate whether he is expected to completely recover from his injuries.;This was the jumper’s first jump after a layoff of several months. The report did not state how many jumps he had made under this canopy or what his canopy experience was, but did mention that he had not received any sort of structured canopy training. Jumpers returning to the sky after a long layoff should do so with a cautious attitude, easing back into jumping slowly and methodically.

The main canopy began to spin rapidly, now attached to the tandem rig by only the right riser. The spin continued as the instructor deployed the reserve canopy, although the main was still attached, since it was too low for a cutaway of the main canopy. The reserve pilot chute entangled with the main canopy, and the tandem instructor spent the remainder of the descent attempting to clear the entanglement. The tandem pair impacted a wooden fence in a back-to-earth position. Both the student and the instructor received immediate medical attention. The tandem instructor suffered back injuries which resulted in paralysis of his legs, and his student suffered mild whiplash and no other injuries.;Investigators discovered that the left tandem riser had rotated and was inverted on the large harness ring. (This occurs relatively frequently on all tandem systems, usually happening when a tandem instructor removes a rig after a jump and places it on the ground.) The inversion placed the majority of the opening-shock load onto the small ring of the three-ring system and nylon loop on the riser. During the opening, it is likely that the nylon loop became torn most of the way through but did not break completely. The loop finally failed when the tandem instructor made the turn at approximately 400 feet. USPA has received several reports of this same type of packing error in the past, but in all the previous cases, the nylon loop failed during deployment, providing enough time for the tandem instructors to release the other riser by pulling their cutaway handles and then deploying their reserves.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;tandem;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;2.0;Yes;done

The canopy opened with line twists and began to spin rapidly. At an altitude reported to be between 1,500 and 2,000 feet, she deployed her reserve canopy without first releasing the main. The reserve canopy inflated, and the two canopies briefly flew in a downplane configuration before settling into a slowly turning side-by-side configuration, which continued until landing. The jumper landed a half mile from the drop zone but received immediate medical attention. She suffered a broken rib and injuries to her pelvis but is expected to make a full recovery.;Although this jumper had performed emergency procedure reviews with many students, this was her first actual malfunction. She stated that she somehow mistook her pillow-style reserve handle for her cutaway handle. On the ground after the jump, investigators found that they could easily pull the main cutaway handle.

All four were wearing wingsuits and had planned to fly back toward the drop zone on a cross-country-type flight. As this jumper exited, he spread his arms and legs immediately after stepping off the door frame, which inflated the wings of his suit instantaneously, and the relative wind pushed him up and into the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft. The aircraft was in level flight during the jump run, and the tail was well above the door. A witness in the airplane observed the jumper, after colliding with the stabilizer, falling in a back-to-earth position, spinning and unresponsive, until he was out of view.;Although the exact number of wingsuit jumps this jumper had made previously was not reported, he was an experienced wingsuit flyer and had just participated in a large-formation wingsuit record earlier in the day. Investigators do not know why he chose to inflate his suit’s arm and leg wings as soon as he stepped off the door of the aircraft. For side-door aircraft such as the Twin Otter, Section 6-9 of the Skydiver’s Information Manual recommends that wingsuit jumpers hold their arms tightly to their sides and their legs together for one second after exiting.

The pilot configured the airplane for jump run at 13,500 feet AGL, which included reducing power, applying flaps and pushing the nose down for level flight before jumpers began to exit. Following a 6-way group, this jumper climbed out of the plane to perform a floating exit as the student prepared for a diving exit. As the student kneeled into position, he inadvertently grabbed the instructor’s metal-D-ring-style reserve ripcord handle while preparing to give the exit count. At the end of the exit count, as the reserve handle pulled loose from the Velcro® and came away from the harness, the student realized he had the handle in his hand. He tried to stop the instructor’s exit by grabbing his harness with the hand that still held the reserve handle, but the instructor let go of the airplane, and the reserve deployed instantly and passed over the tail of the airplane. The instructor was pulled into and over the tail as the reserve inflated. The airplane lurched heavily due to the impact, but the pilot was able to maintain control. The student and the remaining jumpers immediately exited the airplane and landed on the drop zone landing area without incident. Although the stabilizer was damaged, the pilot was able to descend and land the plane safely.;The instructor had planned an exit with no grips, but the student inadvertently grabbed the reserve ripcord handle while getting into position in the door of the airplane. As the student performed the exit count he pushed outward toward the instructor, but both jumpers remained in the door. Reportedly, the exit count was barely discernable and included very little motion, and the instructor may have missed the count entirely.

After an uneventful freefall and initial canopy descent, this jumper made his final approach in a crosswind landing direction, rather than facing directly into the wind. The winds at the time of his landing were reported to be approximately 15 mph with gusts as high as 25 mph. At approximately 30 feet above the ground, as the jumper crossed the runway, the strong winds and turbulence collapsed the left side of his canopy, and he reportedly landed very hard on both feet. The report did not indicate if the canopy was flying straight or turning as he impacted the runway. The hard landing resulted in a broken left femur and tibia, a broken pelvis, damage to his left knee, and his right foot was shattered so severely that amputation was required. The area where the jumper landed was close to a line of trees, which may have led to increased wind turbulence and subsequent canopy collapse. Strong and gusty winds can often lead to hard landings and collapsed canopies, regardless of the size, wing loading or design of the canopy. Category C of USPA’s Integrated Student Program includes training and information regarding turbulence. Jumpers should expect to experience turbulence downwind of an obstacle at 10-20 times its height. In this situation, a better option would have been to select a landing area over a grassy area away from obstacles and face into the wind, rather than landing in a crosswind direction. When winds are strong and gusting, it is safer to stay on the ground and wait for more favorable weather conditions than to risk jumping.;;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done

He then tried to flare the canopy again for his landing, but he struck the ground before the flare had any effect on the canopy. The hard landing resulted in a broken and dislocated right ankle. The report did not indicate if the student attempted a parachute landing fall during the landing.

It was her second jump at this drop zone, and the winds were much lighter for this jump than on her first jump at this drop zone, which took place two days earlier. The report stated that she started her landing pattern too high but did not indicate the exact altitude. She passed over the landing area on her final-approach leg and struck the power lines, dropping approximately 10-12 feet to the ground. The impact resulted in broken canopy suspension lines, and the power lines sparked. The report stated that the jumper was not injured from the landing, but the extent of the damage to her canopy or the power lines was not reported. Jumpers should plan a landing pattern that allows for landing in an area that is free of obstacles. This jumper may not have taken into account the lack of wind on this jump compared to her first jump at the drop zone, when the wind speeds were higher. Jumpers should choose a landing point in the middle of a large open area.

Although she wore a helmet and had tucked her long, braided hair under her jumpsuit, her hair came loose in freefall and was blowing behind her back and container. As she deployed her main canopy, the main bridle and pilot chute entangled with her hair. The entanglement prevented the main from deploying, although the flapping bridle opened the main container, extracting the deployment bag and unstowing the canopy’s lines from it. After realizing what had occurred, she pulled her cutaway handle and tried to clear the mess from her hair, but she remained entangled with the cut-away risers and bridle as she towed her main canopy, still in its deployment bag. The rig was not equipped with a reserve static line (RSL).

The opening point was too far away from the drop zone landing area and necessitated an off-field landing. The jumper descended into an area that included a polo field and a beach, divided by a row of palm trees. At approximately 500 feet, he initiated a 180-degree turn to face into the 15- to 25-mph wind. The report stated that at some point during the turn, the jumper appeared to panic, and seemed as if he could not decide whether to continue the turn to land at the beach or attempt to clear the trees and land on the occupied polo field. At an unreported speed, he struck a palm tree with one side of his canopy, which swung his body toward the trunk of the tree. At approximately eight feet above the ground he impacted the trunk squarely with his body and head. He suffered severe head and facial injuries, as well as multiple broken bones. Although he received immediate medical attention, he died three days later as a result of his severe head injuries, after being removed from life support.;Landing off the drop zone can pose challenges to any skydiver. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 5-1 includes recommendations for dealing with off-field landings. As soon as it is apparent that the drop zone landing area cannot be made, jumpers should select a suitable alternative area and plan a descent. In this case, it appears that there were two suitable open areas, but this jumper may have delayed his final decision as to which area he would use until it was too late to make it safely into either. He also used his final 500 feet of altitude to make a turn into the wind under a highly wing-loaded canopy, which greatly increased his forward speed and reduced the amount of time and altitude he had available to get to one of the open areas. A better option would have been to decide on an alternate landing area as soon as it was apparent that he could not reach the drop zone and to fly a standard, conservative landing pattern with a downwind, base and final-approach leg into the clear area.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;10.0;No;done

The other jumpers on this skydive reported seeing this jumper in a face-to-earth, limp body position after breakoff until impact with the ground. The container was equipped with an automatic activation device (AAD), which activated and cut the closing loop of the reserve container to initiate reserve deployment. The reserve had just reached line stretch when this jumper struck the ground at a high rate of speed. Although the AAD was found to have activated at approximately 750 feet above the ground, witnesses approximately a mile away did not see the reserve canopy extract from the container until just before impact. The reserve freebag and pilot chute were found approximately 30 feet from the jumper. He received immediate medical attention but was pronounced dead at the scene.;"The medical examiner found evidence that this jumper experienced a cardiovascular collapse, and determined he was most likely clinically dead before he impacted the ground. However, the impact resulted in multiple blunt-force-trauma injuries and the actual cause of death was listed as “transaction of the brain stem.” Data retrieved from his audible altimeter shows an increase in freefall speed starting at approximately 2,500 feet; this was most likely when he lost consciousness. The AAD was taken to the U.S. service center for evaluation, and was found to have activated within its design parameters. It was not possible to determine what may have delayed the reserve deployment until just before the jumper reached the ground. There were no burn marks anywhere on the reserve bridle to indicate that the bridle was caught on anything. The reserve pilot chute may have hesitated because of the burble behind the jumper, which can happen when a spring-loaded pilot chute is deployed when a jumper is in a belly-to-earth body position. This can cause a delay of several seconds as the pilot chute bounces around behind the jumper until it clears the burble and begins to extract the reserve from the container.";;Yes;Yes;No;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;4.0;No;done

The lower jumper never saw the other canopy; it was not reported if the other jumper saw the lower jumper during the close call. Had the first jumper turned his canopy directly into the wind it would have prevented him from crossing underneath the other jumper, but either way this was a case of two canopies flying much too closely and at least one jumper failing to see the other under canopy.

His altitude at the start of the turns was unknown, and witnesses did not know if he initiated the turns using his front risers or steering toggles. He was jumping a 109-square-foot canopy at a wing loading of 2.1:1. At this wing loading, the canopy would lose a large amount of altitude while generating considerable forward speed when flown aggressively. As this jumper neared the ground at the completion of the 180-degree turn, the canopy was still descending rapidly and steeply. The jumper started to flare the canopy but struck the ground hard before the flare had much effect on slowing the descent rate and leveling the canopy’s flight. He struck the ground with his feet and knees first before flipping forward onto his chest, head and neck. He received immediate medical attention but died at the scene from multiple injuries including internal, face and head injuries.;This jumper had rapidly downsized through a series of elliptical and cross-braced, high-performance canopies. At just four years and 1,500 jumps worth of experience, he had already downsized through at least five different high-performance canopies. It was also reported that he had a few close calls during poor landings in the past, while jumping different canopies than the one he was using on this jump. The report stated that he had struck the ground hard after making a low turn on at least three previous occasions but apparently did not suffer any serious injuries. This was only his eighth jump using this 109-square-foot, cross-braced canopy. He had reportedly jumped at least two other cross-braced canopies of similar size but from a different manufacturer.

She made a poised exit and what was reported to be a “big jump” out of the aircraft. She struck the horizontal stabilizer, first with her container, then with her left arm as she rolled to the left before dropping clear of the airplane. Her arm was broken by the impact. She deployed her main canopy and landed uneventfully. The report did not indicate if she kept the brakes stowed and landed without flaring the canopy or if she was able to use her left arm to help with steering and the landing flare. Her wing loading was 1:1, light enough to provide for a relatively soft landing in an unusual situation such as this. She received immediate medical attention and was taken to a local hospital by ambulance. The aircraft landed safely but required repair to the stabilizer. Jumpers exiting aircraft with low horizontal stabilizers must use caution while exiting. They should either drop straight off the door or dive down and out during the exit; springing up and out of the door and spreading into a stable arch with a head-high body position increases the chances of striking the horizontal stabilizer. Pilots can help to reduce the chances of a tail strike by configuring the aircraft properly for jump run, which includes leveling the plane so that the tail is in a higher position than during the climb. In the previous seven years there were three fatalities due to jumpers striking the tail of an aircraft and at least six non-fatal accidents in which jumpers struck the tail but survived. Two of the jumpers involved in the non-fatal accidents were knocked unconscious after striking the tail and survived only because their automatic activation devices deployed their reserves.";;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

As he leaned back past the rear edge of the door, the swaged ball on the end of his reserve ripcord lodged in an opening where the original door latch had been located. When the jumper slid backward, the reserve ripcord was pulled and he was extracted off the airplane by his deploying reserve canopy. The inflating reserve struck the horizontal stabilizer. Both the canopy and the jumper then passed underneath the stabilizer and, luckily, cleared the airplane without an entanglement. The reserve was slightly damaged from its impact with the aircraft, with a tear in one of the canopy’s stabilizers and two small tears in the bottom skin. It flew normally, and the jumper landed uneventfully. The airplane suffered damage to its horizontal stabilizer, but the pilot was able to maintain control and land without incident. After landing, he found that the stabilizer on the right side of the airplane was pulled “half-way off” of the tail of the airplane.

Two seconds after the exit she reached for her bottom-of-container-mounted pilot chute and encountered a hard pull. As she struggled with the pull she rolled onto her right side. She extracted the pilot chute, but the bridle went around her neck, causing a horseshoe malfunction. After eight seconds she initiated emergency procedures but did not pull the cutaway handle far enough to release either riser of the main canopy. The reserve deployed and fully inflated, and at some point during this time the main bridle cleared her neck and the main canopy inflated. The two canopies then formed a dragplane (in which one canopy is overhead and one beneath the jumper) with the reserve on top and the main on the bottom. Shortly thereafter the canopies began flying in a downplane and remained in that configuration for the rest of the flight. The jumper struck the side of a house while landing and suffered a broken lower leg, cuts and abrasions. She received immediate medical attention and is expected to recover from her injuries. Packing carefully and maintaining an arched, stable body position can help ensure an uneventful deployment. When both canopies are clear of each other in a downplane, Section 5-1 of the Skydiver’s Information Manual recommends that the jumper disconnect the reserve static line (if altitude permits) and pull the cutaway handle to release the main canopy.;;;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

Upon deployment, his main canopy fully inflated but became entangled with the removable deployment system, which eventually affected the jumper’s ability to control the canopy. (A removable deployment system is specialized equipment used on highly wing-loaded, cross-braced canopies to eliminate as much drag as possible by allowing the jumper to remove the slider, main deployment bag and pilot chute after the canopy is deployed. The slider is connected to the main deployment bag with a lanyard that is longer than the suspension lines, and after deployment the slider is removed from the canopy and the rest of the deployment system is reeled in and stowed for the canopy flight.) After deployment on this jump, the lanyard connecting the slider to the main deployment bag was in front of the canopy, the deployment bag and part of the bridle were entangled with one or more of the canopy’s A lines and the rest of the bridle crossed over the nose, leaving the pilot chute sitting on top of the canopy.;This jumper was flying a 79-square-foot canopy at a wing-loading of 2.8:1. It is possible that the removable deployment system was packed incorrectly, as the lanyard attaching the main bag to the slider should have been behind the canopy during the deployment, which would have prevented the deployment bag and bridle from entangling with the canopy. Even though the canopy deployed with an entanglement of the removable deployment system, it was apparently flying well enough initially that the jumper decided to land it rather than release the main canopy and deploy his reserve. The slider was toward the bottom of both risers and located just behind the jumper’s head. This jumper elected to leave the brakes stowed rather than to try to release the brakes and steer with the toggles. The location of the slider may have been a factor in this decision, since the slider grommets appeared to be close to where the steering toggles were stowed on the rear risers and may have interfered with this jumper’s ability to grasp the steering toggles.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

Following an uneventful freefall, he deployed his main canopy at 4,000 feet, which opened with a line-over malfunction and began to spin rapidly in an unreported direction. Shortly thereafter, he pulled his cutaway handle and released his main canopy and the reserve was deployed immediately, activated by the reserve static line. At that point, two witnesses on the ground observed him in freefall while entangled with the reserve bridle, and he struck the ground with the reserve pilot chute trailing behind him with the bridle wrapped around his torso and through his legs. He was killed instantly by the impact.;Even though he was a student, this skydiver was jumping with his own gear and had packed his own main canopy, which opened with a line-over malfunction. While it is unusual for students to own their own equipment, the gear was reported to be in good condition and the canopies were properly sized for his experience level. Although the exact make and size of the main canopy is unknown, it was reported to be comparably sized to the 253-square-foot reserve. It was not reported whether he was a new or an experienced packer. Jumpers who are new to packing should be trained and supervised by a parachute rigger to ensure that correct packing and inspection procedures are consistently performed on each pack job.

He worked to clear the line twists as the canopy flew straight and level but lost track of time and altitude as he tried to clear them and gain control of the canopy. He finally realized that he had descended down to 1,000 feet but still did not have control of his main canopy, so he pulled his cutaway handle to release the parachute. He then tried to locate his reserve ripcord but did not pull the handle before his automatic activation device deployed his reserve.

However, the jumper suffered some bruising and a cracked rib from the unusual opening. Upon inspection of this jumper’s harness and container, a master rigger found that his pilot chute pouch was made from Cordura material that did not securely hold the main pilot chute in place.

Following an uneventful climbout, during which the instructor held the student’s main pilot chute, the jumper exited in an arched body position as the instructor threw the pilot chute to initiate deployment. The main canopy deployed and fully inflated, but immediately began to spin in an unreported direction. The spiraling continued as the speed of the rotation and the descent rate of the canopy increased. It is unknown if the jumper was simply not responding to the spinning main canopy or if he was trying unsuccessfully to initiate emergency procedures. At approximately 1,000 feet, the reserve pilot chute launched after being deployed by the automatic activation device. However, there was not enough drag on the reserve pilot chute to pull the reserve from the container with the main canopy still attached. At approximately 200-300 feet, the jumper pulled his cutaway handle and released the main canopy, but he struck the ground before his reserve had a chance to clear the freebag and inflate. He was pronounced dead at the scene.;Investigators found the main canopy with one brake still stowed and one released, which they determined to be the cause of the spinning main canopy. The jumper was trained during the first jump course, taught earlier that day, to deal with this type of opening as well as other main canopy problems. He was also asked twice by the radio operator to pull down both toggles to release the brakes to see if the spin would stop. However, he apparently made no attempt to do so. As the spin continued, he was instructed via radio to initiate emergency procedures. The instructions were repeated over the radio more than 40 times, but the jumper did not pull his cutaway handle until he was at approximately 200-300 feet.

He then proceeded to collapse the slider, loosen his chest strap and disconnect the camera wings of his jumpsuit. (Many camera suits include clips that attach the lower corners of the camera wings to the hip area. After the main is deployed, the jumper unclips the wings to prevent them from inflating while flying under canopy). This skydiver then grabbed his main toggles and pulled down to release the brakes and discovered that the right steering line had entangled with the guide ring on the back of the riser. At an altitude reported to have been between 2,000 and 1,500 feet, he pulled the cutaway handle and released his main canopy and then attempted to pull his reserve handle. However, he ran out of time before he could deploy the reserve and struck the ground without an open parachute.

Investigators reported that the second jumper had performed multiple spiraling turns, which placed him at a lower altitude than the first jumper as they approached the landing area on final. Following the first jumper’s diving 270-degree turn, both jumpers were flying in the same direction on final approach. The first jumper came from above and behind the second jumper since his canopy was flying much faster due to his high wing loading and speed-inducing turn to final. His approach path placed him passing close to the left side of the second jumper. When the second jumper turned to the left, there was little to no time for the first jumper to react or avoid the collision, assuming he saw the jumper in front of him. The second skydiver was most likely never aware of the first jumper because the first jumper was initially much farther above and behind him and approaching at a high speed. The report did not indicate a reason for the second jumper’s last-second turn.

Soon after, he collided with another skydiver, his canopy striking the lines of the second jumper’s canopy midway between the risers and the parachute. The collision caused the first jumper’s canopy to partially collapse, spin into line twists and spiral in a diving turn toward the ground for the remainder of his descent, causing him to strike the ground hard. The second jumper’s canopy remained inflated following the collision, and she was able to land uneventfully. The injured jumper received immediate medical attention but died on the way to the hospital as a result of severe trauma from multiple blunt force injuries.;This jumper was participating in a large formation skydive, which, even with a careful breakoff and deployment plan, can lead to congested skies above the main landing area. A large volume of canopy traffic—all trying to land near the same spot at nearly the same time—can lead to a large number of canopies flying closely together.

The first jumper released a small kite connected by a 20-foot string to trail behind him as the other two canopies flew video from behind. At just over 3,000 feet AGL, the first jumper performed two practice flares on his canopy to decide if he should land with the kite attached or release it for landing. His flare slowed his canopy and caused him to gain altitude in relation to the other jumpers, and one of the other jumpers struck him from behind, entangling the two, with the first jumper passing through the second jumper's canopy lines. The first jumper's canopy deflated and collapsed. He then released his main canopy and deployed his reserve, which opened uneventfully. The canopy lines of the second jumper remained entangled with the first skydiver's cutaway canopy but still suspended under his own fully inflated main. After a few seconds, he cutaway and immediately pulled his reserve handle. The other jumper's cutaway canopy was still caught somewhere on this jumper or his equipment, so the deploying reserve did not clear the two entangled mains. This jumper impacted the ground at a high rate of speed with just a few cells of one of the main canopies inflated and the reserve still in its freebag, trapped and entangled in the main canopies. He was found conscious and breathing, but soon had difficulty breathing and was airlifted to a hospital. The report stated he suffered multiple broken bones along with trauma to his spinal cord, which resulted in paralysis that is expected to be permanent.;Canopy formation flying requires specialized training and a plan for each canopy flight, even when there are no plans for contact or docking maneuvers. These plans should cover the exit, canopy flight, break off, and landing procedures for each jumper on the jump. A trained canopy coach or canopy relative work coach should be consulted for any jumps that include proximity flying of parachutes or canopy docking maneuvers. Before the flight, jumpers should carefully review emergency procedures, including responses to canopy entanglements. This jumper was still attached to the other jumper's canopy at approximately 3,000 feet when he cutaway his canopy. A better response may have been to continue to work to clear the entanglement while he still had sufficient altitude and then release the two main canopies once he was sure he had cleared all the lines from himself and his rig. The report indicated that his main canopy was inflated and flying, which would have provided him with some time to work on clearing the lines of the other canopy before cutting away.

After reviewing video footage of the incident, investigators reported that it appeared as though the right rear riser slipped from the jumper's hand as he pulled down on both rear risers, which caused the canopy to dive to the left abruptly. The diving left turn caused the jumper to strike the ground at a very high rate of descent and forward speed. Investigators could not determine if he had kept his steering toggles in his hands as he controlled his canopy with the risers, but he did not attempt to flare the canopy with toggles or rear risers. The video showed that only one-fourth second lapsed between the time when his riser apparently slipped from his hand and when he struck the ground—barely enough time to even realize what had happened, much less react to the situation. This jumper had participated in canopy competitions before this event and had trained with very experienced canopy competitors to learn more about high-performance canopy landings. The report did not indicate the number of jumps this skydiver had made with his current canopy—a 90-square foot cross-braced parachute—but with only four years of skydiving experience and 1,100 total jumps, he would have had to downsize rapidly. His wing-loading of 2.1:1 exceeded the maximum loading recommended by the manufacturer for expert skydivers. This accident shows there is no margin for error when flying highly loaded canopies at fast speeds near the ground. There may have been a slight chance to flare the canopy with toggles and initiate a carving turn instead of striking the ground, but the response would have needed to be immediate once the riser slipped from his hand. Jumpers should keep their toggles in hand until they have landed, even while using risers to control the canopy. Ultimately, all turns must be completed with enough altitude for the canopy to return to straight and level flight for the landing flare.;11.725747706499575;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;Yes;1.0;No;done

It is unclear whether he had a functioning parachute during any part of his canopy ride; however, witness reports indicated his canopy had spinning line twists for at least the last seven to 10 revolutions before he struck the ground in a fast, spiraling descent. He received immediate medical attention but died at the scene from internal injuries suffered in the hard landing.";"Although all witnesses agreed this jumper experienced line twists at the beginning and end of his canopy flight, some said he removed the twists for part of the canopy descent, while others reported that the twists never cleared and that he remained in spinning line twists for the entire descent. Investigators found this jumper with both toggles in his hands, and both of the canopy's brakes released. This likely indicates that he cleared the line twists at some point during descent and then released his brakes to steer his canopy. The report stated this jumper had made aggressive toggle turns in the past. On most makes and models of canopies, it's possible to induce line twists by rapidly pulling down one toggle. In this situation, it would be difficult to regain control of the canopy with the steering lines caught in the line twists, as the canopy would almost certainly remain in a turn until the jumper could clear the twists. This type of self-induced malfunction has led to several fatal landings in the past after jumpers induced spinning line twists at a low altitude and didn't have the time or altitude to handle the problem safely. If a jumper encounters a main canopy that cannot be landed safely, he must initiate emergency procedures at a safe altitude. Section 5-1 of the Skydiver's Information Manual recommends that students and A-licensed jumpers cutaway and deploy their reserve at or above 2,500 feet above the ground, and that B- through D-licensed holders take action at or above 1,800 feet. At some point, it becomes too low for a jumper to cutaway, and deploying the reserve without first cutting away may be the only remaining option to try and slow the descent. Although the Skydiver's Information Manual doesn't recommend a specific altitude for licensed jumpers to transition to a reserve deployment without first cutting away, Section 4 of the SIM recommends that students who are 1,000 feet or below with a partial malfunction deploy their reserve without first cutting away their main. Experienced jumpers should also take into consideration their equipment and each possible malfunction scenario before deciding a hard deck for whether or not to first initiate a cutaway. A jumper should determine this altitude well before he gets on the plane so he can initiate a quick response when an emergency arises. Investigators did not report any problem with this jumper's equipment. They concluded that the uncontrolled spin was most likely the result of spinning line twists induced by a rapid toggle turn at approximately 1,000 feet. Category G of the Integrated Student Program includes ground training and canopy drills, which include maximum-performance canopy turns. These drills help jumpers become familiar with the limits of each canopy they jump. The exercises should be performed above 2,500 feet in case line twists are induced; however, the intent of the drills is for each jumper to learn how their canopy reacts and how their harness begins to rotate just before line twists begin so they can stop the turn before twists are induced.";5.785742006643148;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

Five other jumpers landed uneventfully and were in the landing area waiting to catch the 3,500 square-foot flag. While this skydiver was on final approach, a small child ran into the landing area and into his path and that of his large flag, which utilized a 75-pound weight at the bottom of the leading edge. The jumper was forced to turn hard in order to miss the child, which caused the weight of the flag to swing to one side and catch in a tree. The canopy then dropped the jumper hard from approximately 20 to 40 feet, where he was initially knocked unconscious. He received immediate medical attention at the scene and was airlifted to a local hospital. He suffered multiple broken bones, including vertebrae in his lower back, but is expected to fully recover from his injuries.;Although the landing area had been secured by more than 40 adults and an experienced ground crew, the child had come from a cabin where he had been sleeping, and the ground crew apparently had not anticipated spectators to enter from that side of the field.

Once his canopy inflated, it began to turn in an unreported direction. Shortly after, this jumper collided with a second skydiver from his group who had experienced line twists upon deployment and was unable to steer his main canopy. The first jumper became wrapped in the second jumper's canopy and lines, partially collapsing both parachutes. The entangled jumpers and canopies began to spin, with the second jumper thrown toward the outside of the entanglement and orbiting around the first jumper, who was still caught in the canopies. After 10 to 15 revolutions, the second jumper cut away his main canopy, and his Skyhook RSL activated his reserve almost immediately at an altitude of approximately 500 feet.;Conclusion: As with many fatalities, this was caused by a chain of events that combined for a fatal result. Breaking any of the links in the chain may have changed the outcome. If the two jumpers had been farther apart during deployment, it may have allowed for the canopies to remain clear of each other after opening even though both jumpers experienced canopy problems that prevented on-heading openings. It's possible that the two jumpers tracked away from the formation in similar directions or that other traffic issues prevented them from tracking the direction they needed to go (typically 180 degrees from the center of the formation) to maintain a safe distance between them. Using a flat tracking position can help jumpers achieve more distance from the formation and gain separation from other jumpers in the group.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;Yes;No;Yes;No;2.0;No;done

The jumper using a left-hand pattern was a military jumper under a military parachute system. The canopy damage from the collision indicated the student was probably slightly higher than the military jumper because the student's body and canopy lines struck the front left corner of the military jumper's canopy and suspension lines. The military jumper's canopy had line burns on the leading edges of the top and bottom skins of the parachute, as well as along the top of the canopy. The burns were likely caused by contact with the suspension lines of the student's canopy passing across the nose and top skin of the canopy. The student's reserve container also had line burns, probably created from friction with the military jumper's main canopy lines when the student passed through them during the collision.;;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;2.0;No;done

There were no witnesses to his freefall, deployment, or landing. Almost 48 hours after the jump took place, his body was discovered lying in a field just off of airport property. Investigators found his harness and container approximately 30 feet from where he was located, with his reserve canopy deployed. His main canopy was found nearby, released from the harness and container system, and trapped in its deployment bag. The jumper's hard landing under his reserve canopy had resulted in severe injuries, including a broken leg, ankle, pelvis, and two cervical vertebrae, as well as head injuries. Since he was found away from his harness and container system, investigators determined that he must have survived the initial impact but died of his injuries before he was found or able to get help.;"Investigators found this jumper's gear with the reserve deployed, the reserve's slider all the way down to the risers, and both brakes still stowed. The cutaway handle had been pulled, but the reserve ripcord handle was still attached to the harness. The main canopy had released from the harness and was found nearby, still in its deployment bag due to a bag lock malfunction. The main canopy, cutaway handle, reserve pilot chute, and freebag were all found within a 20-yard radius of the jumper, which would indicate that the cutaway and reserve deployment took place at very low altitudes, likely lower than 1,000 feet above the ground. The jumper likely struck the ground before his reserve had a chance to fully inflate and slow him down to a survivable descent rate. After deploying his main canopy, the jumper apparently experienced a bag lock malfunction; however, it's impossible to determine at what altitude he deployed his main. Investigators concluded that the jumper's automatic activation device had deployed his reserve parachute since the reserve closing loop had been cut by the unit's cutter, and the reserve ripcord was still in its pocket on the main lift web of the harness. The rig was equipped with a reserve static line (RSL), but it was not connected to either riser, and it's unclear whether it was disconnected before or during the jump. Evidence at the scene indicated that the reserve canopy had inflated but did not have enough time to slow the jumper before he struck the ground. Investigators could not determine at what altitude this jumper initiated the main canopy deployment. Skydiver's Information Manual Section 2-1 requires that students and A-license holders deploy no lower than 3,000 feet above the ground to allow enough altitude for them to properly handle a main canopy malfunction, with minimum altitudes of 2,500 feet for B-license holders and 2,000 feet for C- and D-license holders. Section 5-1 recommends students and A-license holders decide upon and take action to initiate emergency procedures by 2,500 feet, while B- through D-license holders should do so by 1,800 feet. Although this jumper pulled his cutaway handle at some point, it's unclear at what altitude. It's also unknown whether his AAD had already deployed his reserve while the main risers and main deployment bag were still attached or if he pulled his cutaway handle to release his main canopy before the AAD activated the reserve. The investigator did not report finding any friction burns on either canopy or line set, indicating that the main and reserve canopies most likely did not rub together during deployment and that the jumper pulled his cutaway handle and released his main canopy before the AAD deployed his reserve. If the RSL had been hooked up to the main risers, the reserve deployment might have been initiated sooner, saving precious altitude and possibly providing more time for the reserve to slow the jumper before landing. Although the AAD had cut the reserve loop, investigators did not return the unit to the manufacturer to determine what altitude the device activated the reserve. According to a representative from the AAD's U.S.-based service center, at least two reasons could explain the low reserve deployment in this jumper's situation: The AAD may have activated the reserve at the unit's preset altitude of 750 feet, but the reserve canopy could have experienced a hesitation during some stage of the deployment and inflation. Just a short delay in any part of the reserve deployment would be enough to make a difference between a safe descent rate and striking the ground at a high rate of speed while the reserve was still inflating. The representative suggested that another possibility was that the inflated main pilot chute and deployment bag might have provided enough drag to slow the jumper below the 78 mph descent rate required to activate the unit. If this was the case and the jumper had pulled his cutaway handle somewhere around 750 feet or slightly higher, it would have taken him a few seconds to reach the necessary speed to activate the AAD, thus initiating the reserve deployment lower than the normal activation height. Still, without the data from the unit or any witness accounts, it's impossible to determine exactly why the reserve did not have enough altitude to slow the jumper to a safe descent rate. The jumper initially survived the landing, as indicated by the fact that he had removed his rig and was found 30 feet away from his gear. However, either no one noticed that he had not returned from the jump or people thought he had intentionally landed near his trailer, where he stayed on the drop zone since it was the last jump of the day. If a skydiver doesn't plan to return to the regular landing area or packing hangar after a jump, he should tell at least one other jumper on the load his plan and make a phone call to manifest after he lands to let them know he landed uneventfully. Some drop zones use a system that requires each jumper to check in with manifest after each load, which can help the DZ determine if a jumper is missing, so a search can begin immediately if necessary. Lastly, the toxicology test conducted on the jumper following the accident indicated a positive test result for the presence of marijuana in a concentration strong enough that the lab technician said the jumper was more than likely under the influence of the drug at the time of his accident. Jumping while under the influence of drugs or alcohol has resulted in injuries and fatalities in the past and is prohibited by the FAA and USPA for a good reason. Drugs and alcohol can slow reaction times and cause many other adverse reactions that can lead to skydiving injuries and fatalities.";3.1617722907147696;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;Yes;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;1.0;No;done

The winds had been stronger earlier in the day but had tapered off for this jump. After an uneventful hop-and-pop, the jumper entered the landing pattern.

The reported surface winds were 7 miles per hour. After exhibiting good canopy control through the landing pattern, the student started the flare when directed by radio but flared slightly unevenly making the canopy start to turn.

It was a clear, 92-degree Fahrenheit day with reported surface winds of 1 to 4 miles per hour. The freefall was uneventful, and the jumper, who was flying a 150-square-foot Aerodyne Research Pilot loaded at 1:1, flew a proper landing pattern. Witnesses reported that on the final leg, the jumper’s wing was level and that the jumper made very minor toggle and harness inputs to stay on the wind line. However, she flared too high, did not perform a parachute landing fall and had a hard landing, injuring her ankle. The jumper confirmed this account. DZ staff and a family member transported her to an urgent-care facility, where medical personnel determined that the jumper had not broken her ankle. They provided her with a walking boot for the injury. Although the jumper had been in the sport for a short time, she had taken four basic-canopy-control courses from two companies. Since receiving her license, the jumper made 40 jumps on a 170-square-foot canopy and 40 jumps on the 150. She consulted with three canopy coaches, two AFF instructors and a Safety and Training Advisor prior to downsizing. However, with only one jump in the previous 30 days, this jumper may have simply been rusty on determining the correct sight picture for the landing flare.;Improperly performing or failing to perform a PLF continues to be the leading cause of jumper injury. As was the case with the majority of skydiving injuries this year, properly performing a parachute landing fall may have allowed this jumper to avoid injury. Although unrelated to the landing, after the jump an investigator inspected the gear and noted that the automatic activation device was off. The jumper remarked that she thought she had turned it on prior to the jump, although when the investigator turned it on, it appeared to be operating correctly. The jumper also indicated that she had gotten a gear check, but the person checking it did not check the AAD, which was located on the back of the container.;3.165326824455023;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

This jumper had become uncurrent numerous times in the previous 20 months, showing up every few months or so to get current again. On this day, the weather was perfect for a currency jump, with 8 mph ground winds and 70-degree Fahrenheit temperatures. The freefall, deployment and initial canopy flight portions of the jump were uneventful. During the final leg of the landing pattern, the jumper buried his left toggle at about 80 feet AGL. This caused him to spiral into the ground, and his body and canopy hit the ground at nearly the same time. The impact broke his left femur, and an ambulance took him to a local trauma center for surgery to repair his leg. The investigator believes that the jumper realized just before he made the sharp turn that he was overshooting the landing area and headed toward powerlines. The investigator also noted that the jumper needed to deviate only 10-15 degrees from his flight path to land in an open space free of obstacles.;"Skydivers Information Manual in several locations covers landing priorities for all landings.

The jumper made what the investigator described as “a well-timed flare” into the main landing area, but the winds were blowing at 20 miles per hour over a nearby 100-foot-tall tree line, causing turbulence. When the jumper was approximately 5 feet above the ground, the turbulence lifted the canopy up to about 30 feet, and then it partially collapsed. The jumper hit the ground hard, feet first, and the impact caused an open fracture of the jumper’s tibia and fibia.;Turbulence is the only invisible obstacle. Dirt or debris in the wind can help identify it, but more often than not, you cannot see it. You can, however, predict where it may occur and avoid those areas. Skydiver’s Information Manual Section 4-C covers turbulence and states that it can be found downwind from an object as far as 10 to 20 times the object’s height. You can also use the formula “wind speed x the object’s height,” which is also accurate and more specific. Using this formula, this jumper should have expected turbulence up to 2,000 feet downwind of the tree line (100-foot-tall object x 20 mph). Turbulence is also more dynamic the closer you are to the object causing it. Here, the jumper landed within the first quarter of that 2,000-foot window, where the turbulence was the most chaotic. This drop zone also had a student landing area that was approximately 1,500 feet away from the tree line. If this jumper had opted to land there, he would still have experienced some turbulence, but it would have been much milder. The investigator described the jumper as “a very competent and current individual” who often performed coach jumps and who was planning to take the AFF Instructor Rating Course the following weekend. This jumper presumably knew about turbulence and how to predict it, but either forgot the information, chose to disregard it or did not realize how strong the winds were. Jumpers should occasionally review the information in SIM Section 4-C, which covers the types of turbulence (rolling, wake and sheer) and which conditions need to be present for the different types to exist. There can even be turbulence in some landing areas on no-wind days, so even jumpers at DZs where the winds tend to be calm can benefit from a refresher.;7.623419446362789;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done

Before the jump, the instructor helped the student draw up a canopy flight plan that indicated the correct landing pattern and direction. The freefall portion of the training jump was uneventful. When the student was under canopy, it was apparent that she could hear the instructor on the radio because she performed a practice flare when asked. After the flare, the instructor directed the student to go to the predetermined holding area. After entering the holding area, the student began to fly her landing pattern at 1,500 feet rather than 1,000 feet as planned. Over the radio, the instructor told the student to remain in the holding area a bit longer, but she continued in the pattern and made the turn to final at 600 feet, which meant she would overshoot the landing area. The instructor told her to make a small 30-degree turn to the left, where she had a straight shot to an open field. Initially, the student appeared to be following this instruction, but at about 100 feet, she made a half-braked 90-degree turn that had her facing in a mostly downwind direction. At about 15 feet above the ground, she flared all the way. The instructor then told her to hold the flare, but the student let up at around 5 feet above the ground, which caused the canopy to surge forward. She did not perform a PLF and dislocated her hip during the faster-than-normal landing.;Along with half-braked flight and flat turns, PLFs are an important emergency procedure for the canopy flight portion of the skydive and a skill that students need to continuously rehearse.;0.0835356785557503;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

As this student boarded a De Havilland Twin Otter, the weather was perfect with clear skies, 70 degrees, and less than 5 MPH wind in the landing area. This jumper's performance was adequate throughout the entire jump and canopy flight, except they flared at 30 feet. The jumper then let their hands up and surged their canopy into the ground without flaring again or performing a parachute landing fall (PLF).;"The Skydiving Information Manual in section 4-A.D.7 ""Final approach and landing"" covers common problems students encounter during this phase of canopy flight. Student pilots should jump large, docile canopies that allow for errors. These canopies should be resistant to stalling and should simply maintain a low airspeed and rate of descent if flared too high. For this reason, we teach students to stop flaring when they realize they have flared too high and hold it there and push the toggles the rest of the way down before reaching the ground. It is required for USPA instructors to teach this technique as part of the first jump course, but only teaching it is not enough for a student to remember it when the ground is rushing towards them. Students remember 20% of what they hear but remember 90% of what they do. Drilling this technique, along with the rest of the emergency procedure, is the only way to overcome the stress of a poorly timed flare and ensure a student will perform adequately in these situations.";0.0567699639566856;Yes;Yes;Yes;student;No;No;No;No;No;No;No;1.0;No;done

It was a 65-degree Fahrenheit day with clear skies, and the reported surface winds were 7-20 miles per hour. At approximately 15 feet above the ground, the jumper encountered a crosswind gust. According to a witness, he started his flare, let back up slightly and then attempted to complete the flare. The jumper ran out of altitude before finishing the flare and landed with the wing not level. The jumper then tried to run out the landing instead of performing a parachute landing fall and planted his left foot hard in the process. He required medical attention for a probable break of his left ankle.;Landing injuries make up a high percentage of overall jumper injuries. From 2019-2020, landing injuries accounted for 60% of incident reports. As in the case of this jumper, failure to flare or PLF (not the poor performance of either) when encountering a non-turn-related landing problem was a significant cause of injury. Jumpers often fail to flare after being distracted by turbulence, obstacles or other landing jumpers. Jumpers who attempt to run out fast landings or slide them in rather than perform a PLF typically injure an ankle or wrist in the process. Student jumpers learn to plan for a PLF on every landing and to stand it up only if the landing is perfect. After a jumper is licensed and has experienced a series of good stand-up landings, it is easy for them to start slacking on the mental and physical practice necessary to maintain other landing skills, including the PLF. This mental shift reduces a jumper's ability to navigate non-turn-related landing problems. A PLF is a landing-emergency skill that, like any other skill, needs maintenance. Jumpers will fare far better when experiencing a landing problem if they have physically practiced PLFs, preferably off an elevated surface. Jumpers should also occasionally land using a PLF simply for practice. This can be on a predetermined “PLF jump” or, even better, reacting to any minor landing anomaly by using a PLF. A not-perfect flare, a slight crosswind component to the landing direction, landing within 50 feet of another jumper or something as simple landing with your shadow in front of you for the first time are good times to practice a PLF. Adding this semi-unpredictable practice hones the skill, builds confidence and situational awareness and increases the odds of the jumper acting appropriately when a more serious landing problem arises. The jumper in this incident report may well have escaped injury by executing a good PLF. The gusty conditions—7 mph gusting to 20, a 13-mph range—also contributed to this incident. Students may jump only if the winds are 14 mph or less, but once licensed, jumpers enjoy the ability to set their own wind limits. Wind speed is a crucial factor in setting personal limits, but—especially at higher wind speeds—so is the gust range. At wind speeds under the student level, gust ranges typically stay well within the safe range, but as wind speeds increase, gusts can become dangerous. Therefore, it is essential for jumpers to determine what their gust-range limit is. Some instructors suggest a four/one-third formula for setting wind and gust limits after student status. In this system, jumpers increase their wind limits in 4 mph increments as their skills increase but always set their gust-range limit at one third of overall wind speed. So, an A-licensed jumper would set their new wind limit at 18 mph (the student limit of 14 plus 4) with a maximum wind-gust spread of 6 mph (one third of 18). Jumpers can adjust these factors as they gain experience in windy conditions, but the gauge should be successfully navigating landing problems at the high end of their wind range, not simply how many good landings they’ve made in perfect conditions. The reality is that eventually, a jump will not go according to plan–just as it did not for this jumper—and you will want to have mentally and physically rehearsed your response to overcome the panic that comes with these situations and respond appropriately.;7.737132377094342;Yes;Yes;Yes;licensed;No;No;No;No;Yes;No;No;1.0;No;done
